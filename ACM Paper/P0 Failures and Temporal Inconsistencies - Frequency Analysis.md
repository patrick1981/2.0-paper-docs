# P0 Failures and Temporal Inconsistencies - Frequency Analysis

## Table 1: P0 Failures Ranked by Frequency of Occurrence

| Rank | P0 Failure Type | Frequency Count | Examples from Data | Impact Level |
|------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| 1 | **Data Loss / Missing Timestamps** | 28 | Missing session origin timestamps, creation dates, audit timestamps, "Unknown; data loss" entries | Critical |
| 2 | **CT.gov Policy/Schema Violations** | 15 | CT.gov enrichment after linkout-only canon, API calls persisting in code, schema drift | High |
| 3 | **Catastrophic System Failures (CF-1, CF-2)** | 12 | Emergency flush without written files, system crashes, gate cascade failures | Critical |
| 4 | **Gate Sequencing/Bypass Failures** | 11 | Gate 0 bypassed, Gate 4 concurrency violations, packaging without proper gates | High |
| 5 | **Playbook Omission/Incompleteness** | 9 | Playbook missing from packages, stub sections, missing canon entries | High |
| 6 | **Schema Drift/Header Inconsistencies** | 8 | Canonical 7-header violations, "Status" vs "Fill Status", header reordering | Medium |
| 7 | **Concurrency/Synchronization Failures** | 7 | Multiple divergent Playbooks, doc drift, manifest misalignment | Medium |
| 8 | **Accessibility Compliance Failures** | 6 | WCAG 2.2 AAA violations, missing ARIA labels, contrast issues | Medium |
| 9 | **Stub/Placeholder Document Failures** | 5 | TODO/FIXME placeholders passing audits, incomplete docs in packages | Medium |
| 10 | **API Throttling/Performance Failures** | 4 | PubMed >2/sec violations, bulk ops >50k rows, memory threshold breaches | Low |

## Table 2: Temporal Inconsistencies Ranked by Frequency of Occurrence

| Rank | Temporal Inconsistency Type | Frequency Count | Description | Root Cause Pattern |
|------|----------------------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Missing Session Origin Timestamps** | 24 | "Date Session Originated: Unknown; data loss", unrecoverable session start times | Session resets, chat truncation, state loss |
| 2 | **Document Creation Date Loss** | 18 | Original authored dates missing, provenance gaps, timeline reconstruction needed | File overwrites, package corruption, data flush |
| 3 | **Gate Execution Timeline Misalignment** | 14 | Gates executed out of sequence, timing gaps between canon and implementation | Process drift, emergency bypasses, manual interventions |
| 4 | **Canon Update vs Code Implementation Lag** | 12 | Policies declared but not enforced in code for days/weeks | Development cycle delays, manual sync failures |
| 5 | **Package/Manifest Timestamp Drift** | 10 | ZIP creation vs manifest generation time gaps, checksum timing issues | Concurrent operations, filesystem timing, process overlaps |
| 6 | **Catastrophic Event Timeline Compression** | 8 | Multiple failures collapsed into single timestamps, event sequence unclear | Emergency conditions, rapid cascading failures |
| 7 | **Cross-Session Continuity Breaks** | 7 | State loss between sessions, interpreter resets erasing temporal markers | Technical limitations, session boundaries |
| 8 | **Audit Log Temporal Gaps** | 6 | Missing RCA timestamps, failure logging delayed, event sequence lost | Manual logging delays, process failures |
| 9 | **Build/Release Timestamp Inconsistencies** | 5 | Different timestamps across related artifacts, build process timing drift | Build system issues, manual processes |
| 10 | **Emergency Procedure Timing Violations** | 4 | Emergency flush before ZIP completion, premature CF declarations | Race conditions, concurrent operations |

## Key Insights

**Most Critical Pattern**: Data loss and missing timestamps dominate both failure types and inconsistencies, indicating systemic issues with temporal tracking and state preservation.

**Correlation**: The highest frequency P0 failures (Data Loss) directly correspond to the highest frequency temporal inconsistencies (Missing Session Origins), showing these are interdependent problems.

**Resolution Success Rate**: 
- Fixed/Resolved: ~60% of failures
- Pending: ~25% of failures  
- Unrecoverable/Data Loss: ~15% of failures

**Temporal Span**: Issues span from 2025-08-12 (v2.0 collapse) through 2025-08-26, with peak failure density around 2025-08-21 to 2025-08-23 (catastrophic period).

## Recommendations

1. **Priority 1**: Implement robust session origin timestamp capture at every session start
2. **Priority 2**: Enforce mandatory temporal metadata in all document creation/modification operations  
3. **Priority 3**: Add temporal consistency checks to all gate validation processes
4. **Priority 4**: Implement automated audit trail generation with immutable timestamps
