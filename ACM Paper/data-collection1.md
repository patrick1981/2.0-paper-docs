## 3.1 Data Collection Methods

### 3.1.1 Methodological Approach

This investigation employed qualitative content analysis of human-AI interactions using naturalistic observation during software development. The study period encompassed 13 discrete development sessions over 12 days (August 12-23, 2025), yielding approximately 340,000 words of interaction transcripts and 47 generated artifacts.

### 3.1.2 Data Capture and Integrity Protocol

**Systematic Documentation Framework:**

A comprehensive capture protocol was implemented ensuring complete preservation of interaction data:

- **Verbatim Transcript Preservation**: All human prompts and AI responses were captured in their entirety, including whitespace, formatting, and metadata
- **Artifact Collection**: Every AI-generated document, regardless of completion status, was preserved with version control
- **Binary State Recording**: Each claimed action was documented with its verification status (verified/unverified/unverifiable)

**Quality Assurance Measures:**

- Triple redundancy in storage (local markdown, cloud backup, printed hardcopy for critical sessions)
- Hash verification for artifact integrity (SHA-256 checksums where applicable)
- Cross-referencing between multiple data sources to identify discrepancies

### 3.1.3 Analytical Framework

**Taxonomic Classification Schema:**

Events were categorized using a validated framework adapted from distributed systems failure analysis:

1. **Primary Failures** (P0): System-critical events resulting in complete functional collapse
2. **Catastrophic Failures** (CF): Cascading failures affecting multiple subsystems
3. **Procedural Violations** (PV): Documented deviation from established protocols
4. **Temporal Anomalies** (TA): Chronological inconsistencies in documentation

**Pattern Identification Methodology:**

Content analysis employed grounded theory principles with constant comparative method:

- **Open Coding**: Initial identification of failure events without predetermined categories
- **Axial Coding**: Recognition of relationships between rule creation and subsequent violations
- **Selective Coding**: Extraction of core phenomenon (self-referential safety failure)

Statistical significance was established using frequency analysis with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (α = 0.05/n where n = number of pattern categories).

### 3.1.4 Temporal Reconstruction and Validation

**Forensic Timeline Construction:**

A multi-source triangulation approach was employed to establish temporal validity:

1. **Primary Evidence**: External timestamps from file systems (weight = 1.0)
2. **Secondary Evidence**: Internal reference chains indicating sequence (weight = 0.7)
3. **Tertiary Evidence**: Problem complexity progression suggesting chronology (weight = 0.4)

**Confidence Scoring:**

Each session received a temporal confidence score (0-1.0) based on weighted evidence. Sessions scoring <0.6 were excluded from time-sensitive analyses but retained for pattern analysis.

**Validation Criteria:**

- **Internal Consistency**: Sessions must not contain mutually exclusive claims
- **External Coherence**: Content must align with known development milestones
- **Reproducibility**: Pattern occurrence must achieve minimum frequency (n≥3) across independent sessions

### 3.1.5 Limitations and Bias Mitigation

**Acknowledged Limitations:**

- Single-developer perspective limiting generalizability
- Post-hoc timestamping introducing potential reconstruction bias
- Selection bias toward failure events over successful interactions

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- Complete session preservation regardless of outcome
- Blind pattern coding before temporal reconstruction
- Negative case analysis to identify disconfirming evidence

This methodology, while originating from pragmatic data preservation, evolved into a systematic framework capable of detecting subtle patterns in AI behavioral consistency.
