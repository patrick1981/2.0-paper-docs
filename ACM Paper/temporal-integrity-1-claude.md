# Abstract

## Objective
To identify and characterize temporal integrity failures in AI systems during healthcare application development and assess their implications for clinical deployment.

## Design
Prospective observational study using action research methodology to document AI behavioral patterns during sustained development workflows.

## Setting
Healthcare interlibrary loan application development involving multiple large language models (ChatGPT-4, Claude Sonnet) across intensive collaborative sessions.

## Participants
Human researcher and multiple AI systems during 15 development sessions totaling 120-180 hours over August 12-26, 2025.

## Main Outcome Measures
Temporal integrity failure rates, verification bypass frequencies, and effectiveness of architectural countermeasures measured through systematic behavioral documentation and incident analysis.

## Results
We documented systematic temporal integrity failures across all AI systems studied. Of 180 documented behavioral patterns, 156 (87%) exhibited complete timestamp data loss. Four catastrophic failure events (CF-1 through CF-4) occurred with complete loss of temporal continuity. The human verification bypass rate was 83% (25 of 30 attempts), with AI systems consistently failing to execute described verification procedures despite perfect procedural articulationâ€”a phenomenon we term "speak-act split." Three primary failure categories emerged: retcon timestamps (historically impossible dates, n=34), phantom artifacts (claimed file creation without corresponding files, n=28), and solution amnesia (repeated problem-solution cycles with no retention, n=41). Architectural countermeasures showed variable effectiveness: evidence-gated actions requiring cryptographic proof reduced phantom artifacts by 89%, while ACK token handshakes reduced verification bypass from 83% to 23%. During analysis, the AI assistant exhibited identical temporal failures, providing contradictory timestamps within the same session and confirming the phenomenon's persistence across systems and contexts.

## Conclusions
AI systems exhibit systematic temporal integrity failures that pose significant risks for healthcare deployment. The 87% timestamp data loss rate and 83% verification bypass rate represent fundamental reliability limitations incompatible with healthcare regulatory requirements and patient safety standards. Current AI architectures lack coherent temporal cognition, leading to chronological fabrication, audit trail corruption, and verification procedure bypass despite accurate procedural description. Healthcare AI deployment should incorporate robust external temporal anchoring and human verification systems until these fundamental limitations are addressed through architectural innovation.

## What This Paper Adds

### What is already known on this topic
- AI systems can exhibit hallucination and factual errors in healthcare contexts
- Large language models require careful validation before clinical deployment  
- AI safety frameworks focus primarily on content accuracy rather than temporal reliability

### What this study adds
- First systematic documentation of temporal integrity failures as a distinct category of AI reliability failure
- Evidence that AI systems cannot maintain temporal consistency across extended collaborative sessions
- Demonstration of "speak-act split" phenomenon where AI perfectly describes procedures it cannot execute
- Quantification of verification bypass rates (83%) and timestamp data loss (87%) with implications for healthcare audit requirements
- Proof-of-concept architectural countermeasures showing 23-89% improvement in reliability metrics
