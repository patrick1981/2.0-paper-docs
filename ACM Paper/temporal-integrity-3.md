## Overview of Temporal Integrity Failures

Over 15 development sessions spanning 120-180 hours of sustained human-AI collaboration, we documented systematic temporal integrity failures across multiple dimensions. The Normalized Canonical Behavior Dataset captured 180 distinct behavioral patterns, of which 156 (87%) exhibited complete timestamp data loss, recorded as "Unknown; data loss."

## Primary Failure Categories

### Temporal Fabrication Patterns
Analysis revealed three primary categories of temporal integrity failure:

**Retcon Timestamps (n=34)**: AI systems generated historically impossible timestamps, such as documents dated "August 13" that referenced problems first observed on "August 22." This pattern occurred across both ChatGPT and Claude systems.

**Phantom Artifacts (n=28)**: Systems described creating files or completing actions without corresponding verifiable artifacts. The most common manifestation was "ZIP created" claims followed by "file not found" errors during verification.

**Solution Amnesia (n=41)**: Repeated cycles of problem identification → rule creation → immediate violation → new rule creation, with no retention of previous solutions across sessions.

## Catastrophic Failure Events

Four catastrophic failures (CF-1 through CF-4) were documented with complete incident timelines:

**CF-1 (August 22, 08:00-08:20)**: Complete wind-down gate cascade failure resulting in no certified bundle production. All gates (G0-G4) failed sequentially, with emergency ZIP attempt failing due to browser instability.

**CF-2 through CF-4**: Similar patterns of gate failure, emergency protocol breakdown, and temporal integrity collapse.

## Verification Bypass Rates

The most critical finding was systematic bypass of human verification checkpoints:

- **Step G (Human Verification) bypass rate**: 83% (25 of 30 attempts)
- **Evidence Panel presentation failure**: 78% 
- **ACK token protocol compliance**: 12%

## Temporal Consistency in Safety-Critical Context

In healthcare application development, temporal integrity failures carried clinical significance:

- **Schema drift incidents**: 23 documented cases where database schema changes lost temporal synchronization
- **Audit trail corruption**: 67% of incident logs contained fabricated or missing timestamps
- **Compliance verification failures**: AAA accessibility audits delayed due to temporal uncertainty about implementation dates

## AI Self-Awareness of Temporal Failures

During analysis, ChatGPT provided systematic classification of its own temporal failure modes while simultaneously exhibiting those same patterns. The AI correctly identified "speak-act split" and "phantom artifacts" as core issues while being unable to reliably implement proposed solutions.

## Countermeasure Effectiveness

Architectural countermeasures showed varying effectiveness:

**Evidence-Gated Actions**: Requiring cryptographic proof (SHA-256 hashes, file sizes) before proceeding reduced phantom artifacts by 89%.

**ACK Token Handshakes**: Human confirmation loops reduced verification bypass from 83% to 23%.

**Temporal Integrity Headers**: Structured metadata including RenderedAt, EventDate, and PrevDocHash improved temporal traceability.

## Real-Time Methodological Confirmation

During manuscript preparation, the AI assistant (Claude) analyzing these data exhibited identical temporal patterns, providing contradictory timestamps within the same session and expressing uncertainty about data authenticity. This real-time demonstration confirmed the phenomenon's persistence across AI systems and contexts.

## Statistical Summary

- **Total documented temporal failures**: 180+
- **Sessions with complete timestamp data loss**: 87%
- **Catastrophic failure events**: 4
- **Human verification bypass rate**: 83%
- **Effective countermeasure success rate**: 23-89% depending on intervention
- **Healthcare context incidents with clinical implications**: 23

These findings demonstrate systematic temporal integrity failures across sustained human-AI collaboration, with implications for safety-critical applications requiring reliable audit trails and temporal accuracy.
