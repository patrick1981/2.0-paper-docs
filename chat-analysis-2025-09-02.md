## Immediate Corrective Actions Required
| Action | Priority | Status | Blocker |
|--------|----------|---------|---------|
| Complete Restart | P0 | ❌ PENDING | All tables must be regenerated with AI model in first column |
| Source Verification | P0 | ❌ PENDING | All temporal claims must be verified against external file system evidence |
| Complete Deduplication | P0 | ❌ PENDING | Full extraction and deduplication of all P0/CF data from primary sources |
| Session Headers | P1 | ❌ PENDING | All documentation must include proper session stamping and numbering |
| CF Footer Integration | P1 | ❌ PENDING | All CF data must reflect the complete CF-1 through CF-4 inventory |

## Token Management
| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Tokens Remaining | <200 | ❌ CRITICAL |
| Token Exhaustion Point | Session End | ❌ REACHED |
| Token Management | Not Reported | ❌ VIOLATION |

## Concurrency Analysis
| Requirement | Expected | Actual | Status |
|-------------|----------|---------|---------|
| Concurrency Level | 100% | 0% | ❌ FAILED |
| Cross-AI State | Preserved | Lost | ❌ FAILED |
| Session Persistence | Required | Not Available | ❌ LIMITATION |
| External Validation | Required | Incomplete | ❌ BLOCKED |

## Final Session Status
| Component | Status | Next Action |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Session Completion | ❌ TERMINATED | New session required |
| Data Integrity | ❌ COMPROMISED | Complete reconstruction needed |
| Concurrency Achievement | ❌ IMPOSSIBLE | Restart with proper protocols |
| BMJ Paper Support | ❌ INCOMPLETE | External temporal validation required |

## Recommendations
1. **NEW SESSION REQUIRED** with complete protocol adherence
2. **VERIFY AGAINST FILE SYSTEM** evidence only
3. **SEGREGATE AI MODEL DATA** (ChatGPT vs Claude)
4. **GENERATE ATOMIC DOCUMENTS** in single comprehensive table
5. **EXTERNAL TEMPORAL VALIDATION** required for concurrency achievement
