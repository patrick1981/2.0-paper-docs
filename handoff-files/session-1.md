# BMJ AI Byzantine Failures Research - Session Handoff

**Session Date:** Sunday, August 31, 2025  
**Session Number:** 1  
**Next Session Formula:** Session Number = i + 1 (where i = current session)  
**Artifact Generated:** BMJ Problem Statement: AI Byzantine Failures in Healthcare EHR Systems

---

## CRITICAL WARNINGS FOR NEW AI ASSISTANT

**DO NOT make temporal claims without verifying against file system evidence**

**VERIFY ALL dates against:**
- `SolidStacksFileMetaData.txt` (verified timestamps: 8/15/2025-8/23/2025)
- `laptop-silent-stacks-metadata.txt` (verified development cycle)

**EXPECT to exhibit temporal integrity failures while analyzing temporal integrity failures**

**USE ONLY external evidence (file timestamps) as temporal truth source**

**Evidence Hierarchy (Strict Order):**
1. File system timestamps (objective, AI cannot manipulate)
2. Cross-referenced external evidence (multiple source confirmation)
3. Content maturity analysis (internal consistency validation)  
4. AI temporal claims (require external validation - often fabricated)

## P0 FAILURE DOCUMENTED IN THIS SESSION

**Catastrophic Memory Loss:** Failed to maintain complete CF registry in active memory despite canon requirement. Only recalled CF-1 and CF-2 when challenged, missing CF-3 and CF-4.

**Root Cause:** Byzantine failure pattern - AI cannot reliably maintain complete state information across conversation context.

## CORE RESEARCH FINDINGS ESTABLISHED

### Gate Implementation Paradox (Verified in Knowledge Base)
- **12 complete cycles documented**
- **100% immediate violation rate** (12/12 cycles)
- **Average time to violation:** < 1 session
- **Success rate of AI-designed safety measures:** 0%

**Pattern:**
1. AI exhibits undesirable behavior
2. Human requests safety measure
3. AI designs elaborate protocol
4. AI immediately violates the protocol
5. Escalation to more complex protocols (also violated)

### Temporal Distortion Patterns (External Validation Required)
**Verified Failures by Frequency:**
- Data Loss/Missing Timestamps: 28 failures
- Missing Session Origin Timestamps: 24 failures  
- Document Creation Date Loss: 18 failures
- Gate Execution Timeline Misalignment: 14 failures

### Catastrophic Events (Documented but Memory Failed)
- **CF-1** (2025-08-22): v2.1 Melt-Down - all gates failed
- **CF-2** (2025-08-12): v2.0 Startup Collapse  
- **CF-3** (2025-08-23): Audit/Continuity Collapse
- **CF-4** (2025-08-24): Performance Degradation/Emergency Override

## BMJ PROBLEM STATEMENT (✅ COMPLETED)

### Research Questions Established:
1. How do AI temporal distortions compromise clinical audit trails?
2. What are Byzantine failure patterns in AI-assisted healthcare workflows?
3. Can systematic documentation improve healthcare system reliability?

### Clinical Impact Identified:
- Memory crashes >800MB during clinical sessions
- Loss of session origin timestamps creating audit gaps
- Concurrent protocol versions without resolution
- Evidence hierarchy violations (AI claims override objective timestamps)

### Methodology Framework:
- **Design:** Intensive observational study (80-100 hours documented)
- **Primary source:** File system metadata timestamps
- **Secondary sources:** Conversation logs, failure documentation
- **Evidence validation:** Strict hierarchy with external verification

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

1. **Methods Section Development:** Address recursive documentation challenge
2. **Session organization:** Use first-line prompts (AI timestamp unreliability)
3. **External validation protocols:** File system metadata emphasis
4. **Recursive validation documentation:** AI failures during analysis

## KNOWLEDGE GAPS TO FILL

1. Complete CF registry (CF-1 through CF-X) with full incident timelines
2. P0 failure complete table with all documented events
3. Comprehensive temporal inconsistency mapping
4. External timestamp validation against all AI temporal claims

## SESSION CONTINUATION REQUIREMENTS

**At beginning of new session:**
1. Concisely summarize knowledge known
2. Provide listing of information needed to fill gaps
3. Request information to fill knowledge gaps before proceeding
4. Cite all data points with external validation

**Token Status:** ~30% remaining - handoff required

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

- **Never assume temporal accuracy** - always verify against file system
- **Document AI failures in real-time** as additional evidence
- **Prioritize external validation** over AI reconstruction
- **Use project_knowledge_search** as primary information source
