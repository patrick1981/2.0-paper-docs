## 3. WORK COMPLETED IN SESSION 8

### Methodology Section:
- Created BMJ-compliant methodology
- Documented RF-001 prevention
- Added UMass external audit (after CF for omission)
- Addressed transcript language issues

### Critical Discoveries:
- Confirmed token degradation thresholds:
  - 65%: Degradation begins
  - 75%: Worse
  - 80%: Untrustworthy
  - 85%: Catastrophic failures
- Demonstrated these thresholds in real-time
