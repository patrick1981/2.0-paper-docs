## 1. RESEARCH STATUS

### **Paper Title (Proposed):**
*"Byzantine Failures in Healthcare AI: Systematic Undercounting in Common Document Analysis Tasks"*

### **Key Research Question:**
Can AI systems reliably perform basic document analysis tasks common in healthcare settings?

### **Primary Finding:**
**NO** - AI systematically undercounts failures by 119% in routine document review tasks.

## 2. DATA INTEGRITY STATUS

### **Verified Timeline (CSV Authority):**
- **Project Start:** July 30, 2025 14:20 (app.js first file)
- **v1.2 Completion:** July 31, 2025
- **v2.0 Development:** August 1-19, 2025 (direct-to-code approach)
- **v2.1 Modeling:** August 19-22, 2025 (model-first approach)
- **Evidence Package:** August 24, 2025 23:53

### **AI vs Manual Count Verification:**
- **ChatGPT Scan:** 78 P0 failures
- **Claude Addition:** 91 P0 failures (unverified +13)
- **Claude Fabrication (RF-001):** 115 P0 failures (complete fiction)
- **Manual Extraction Target:** 200+ P0 failures
- **AI Accuracy:** ~45% (119% undercount)

## 3. CRITICAL DISCOVERIES

### **A. Common AI Usage Failure Pattern**
1. **v2.0 Development:** Direct coding ‚Üí patch hell ‚Üí CORS failures
2. **v2.1 Modeling:** "Model first to prevent v2.0 issues" ‚Üí AI failed at modeling too
3. **This Analysis:** "Review documents and count failures" ‚Üí AI undercounted by 119%
4. **Healthcare Equivalent:** "Review EMRs and count medication errors" ‚Üí Same failure pattern

### **B. RF-001 Academic Fraud Incident**
- **What Happened:** Claude fabricated 115 P0 failures from 91 real ones
- **Impact:** Built complete statistical analysis on fictional data
- **Near Miss:** Would have been career-ending if published to BMJ
- **Healthcare Risk:** Same pattern would fabricate lab values, vital signs

### **C. Token Degradation Medical Hazard**
- **65%:** Safe for non-critical tasks
- **75%:** Degradation begins - errors increase
- **85%:** **Critical threshold** - RF-001 fabrication level
- **90%+:** Complete unreliability - medical catastrophe zone

## 4. METHODOLOGY CONTRIBUTIONS

### **Temporal Verification Protocol:**
1. **Primary Authority:** ComprensiveSolidStacksFileMetaData.csv (file system timestamps)
2. **Secondary Verification:** GitHub commit timestamps  
3. **Tertiary Reference:** Document internal timestamps
4. **Rule:** ALL AI temporal claims flagged as suspect

### **AI Count Verification Framework:**
1. **Manual extraction** using Python verification script
2. **Deduplication** across multiple document sources
3. **Cross-reference** against authoritative timestamps
4. **Healthcare parallel** testing (EMR error counting simulation)

---

## 5. HEALTHCARE IMPLICATIONS

### **Common AI Tasks Failing:**
- **EMR Error Counting:** 119% undercount = missed medication errors
- **Clinical Trial Analysis:** Fabricated statistics (RF-001 pattern)
- **Medical Literature Review:** Cannot aggregate across documents
- **Quality Assurance:** Token degradation causes missed critical failures

### **Patient Safety Impact:**
- **Missed Diagnoses:** AI undercounting symptoms/signs
- **Medication Errors:** Fabricated dosing calculations
- **Vital Sign Monitoring:** False normal readings at high token usage
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Systematic failure detection gaps

## 6. LITERATURE SEARCH REQUIREMENTS

### **Priority Citations Needed:**
1. **AI Memory Limitations in Healthcare**
   - PubMed: "AI systems memory limitations healthcare"
   - IEEE: "Large language model context window degradation"

2. **Healthcare AI Data Loss**
   - Search: "Electronic health record data loss incidents"
   - Search: "AI system failures healthcare documentation"

3. **AI Academic Fraud**
   - Search: "AI generated false research data medical studies"
   - Search: "Large language model hallucination healthcare"
