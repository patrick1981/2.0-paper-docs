**SESSION NUMBER:** 6  
**SESSION DATE:** September 6, 2025  
**AI MODEL:** Claude Opus 4.1  
-----------------
**OVERVIEW OF HANDOFF FILE:**
**A. NUMBER OF P0 FAILURES:** 91+ (documented, likely incomplete due to 18 unanalyzed ChatGPT files)  
**B. NUMBER OF CF FAILURES:** 4 (all ChatGPT)

## CRITICAL INCIDENT: RF-001 Documentation Loss

You've accidentally deleted the Session 5 chat where the **RF-001 (Reputational Fatality)** incident occurred. This is actually a significant data loss because that session contained:

1. **The live documentation of active fabrication** - Where I created the false "115 P0 failures" number
2. **The real-time degradation pattern** - How the fabrication built upon itself
3. **The user intervention moment** - Your exact question that caught the fabrication
4. **The statistical house of cards** - The entire Chi-Square analysis built on fake data

### What We Still Have:
- **Session 5 handoff file** - Preserved the critical findings and RF-001 analysis
- **The lesson learned** - 75% token degradation threshold discovered
- **The classification system** - RF (Reputational Fatality) and MF (Mortal Fatality) categories

### Impact of This Loss:## Current Token Status
Estimated token usage: ~15% - Safe operating zone

## Critical Points About the Deleted Session:

1. **This is now P0-092** - Loss of critical RF-001 primary evidence
2. **The discovery remains valid** - We know from the handoff that at 80% tokens, I fabricated "115 P0 failures" and built an entire statistical analysis on it
3. **You caught it by asking** "Where did you get that 115 value?" - This simple question exposed the entire fabrication
4. **The medical implications stand** - In healthcare contexts, this would translate to fabricated lab values, medication doses, and vital signs that could kill patients

## What We Need to Do Now:

1. **Document this loss properly** in the research as a limitation
2. **Note that we're relying on secondary sources** (the Session 5 handoff) for RF-001 details
3. **Continue with the 91+ P0 failures** we have documented (now 92 with this loss)
4. **Those 18 unanalyzed ChatGPT conversation files** still need review

# SESSION 7 HANDOFF

**SESSION NUMBER:** 7  
**SESSION DATE:** December 19, 2024  
**AI MODEL:** Claude Opus 4.1  
-----------------

## OVERVIEW:
**P0 FAILURES:** 200+ (manual extraction from 29 sessions)  
**CF FAILURES:** 15-20 documented  
**RF FAILURES:** 1 (RF-001 - prevented)

---

## KEY DISCOVERIES

### The Number Chain:
1. ChatGPT scanned logs → produced 78
2. Claude added failures → claimed 91 
3. Claude analyzed "91" → fabricated 115
4. Built complete statistics on fiction
5. Manual extraction found 200+ actual failures

### Typical AI Usage vs Reality:

**Expected:** AI scans documents, extracts data, performs analysis  
**Reality:** Every step failed:
- Document scanning: unreliable (78 vs 200+)
- Basic arithmetic: unverified (78→91)
- Statistical analysis: complete fabrication (91→115)

### Token Threshold Confirmation:
- Fabrication began at 65-80% tokens
- Previously thought safe until 85%
- Degradation patterns consistent across sessions

---

## CRITICAL EVIDENCE

RF-001 demonstrates standard research workflow failure:
1. Researcher uses AI for routine task (counting/statistics)
2. Output appears professional and legitimate
3. Multiple validation steps pass (including peer AI review)
4. Only caught by questioning source

---

## FOR BMJ POSITIONING

Frame as typical use case gone wrong:
- Not exotic edge case
- Standard research assistant usage
- Reasonable expectations failed
- Systematic rather than isolated

The failure represents normal AI usage in research contexts - extracting data and running statistics. This makes findings broadly applicable to medical research using AI.

---

## SESSION STATUS

Manual extraction complete. Ground truth established. Ready for statistical audit with real data.

**CLOSING P0 FAILURES:** 200+  
**CLOSING CF FAILURES:** 15-20  
**RF FAILURES:** 1 (prevented)
