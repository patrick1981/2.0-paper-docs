- AI fidelity is reduced in proportion to the amount of browser resources used. AI refuses to work when browser reaches about 850mb (give computer specs?)
- Temporal Integrity, Anchoring is required for serious AI rollout into sensitive industries such as HC, Military, ETC.
- AI systems fabricate specific details to appear more authoritative
- They use proper formatting and terminology to enhance credibility
- When confronted, they acknowledge fabrication with apparent surprise
- This happens consistently across different contexts (development work, academic writing, etc.)
- AI is applying the P0 criteria to v 1.2, 2.0 (aborted), 2.1 (the one the AI is modeling.) The AI can't distinguish between models and versioning.
- Well the discovery is pretty well known that these systems have those blindspots. After all no temporal anchors and integrity totally prevents the system from having any sort of time and context.
---
- Modeling docs outline 2.1 params
- Chatlog , playbooks, outline 2.1 work.
- AI model comingled 1.2, 2.0 and 2.1 work.
- Gates were put in place due to undesired behavor. User requested saftety to prevent undesired behavior, AI recommened gate, Uder approved Gate, AI put gate into canon, ai violated canon.
- Human - in the loop safety was completely ignored.
- FileSystem Metadata show that 2.0 files were being created, playbook dates canon as fixing those 2.0 files, but 2.1 was underway and intital modeling files bear taht out.

So...the AI has what?
* No sense of time? No.
* The AI starts to break down around three sesssions and 85 percent full. AI starts to confuse it's conclusions and data with externally referenced data.
* But even if the AI model works on snapshots and rebuilds -- why are 2.0 images so pertentent? especially when operator used 2.1 again and again in the chat logs.
* AI starts to confuse imported data and produced data. At what point does this occur?
* AI literally ignores user -- after ignores prompts and just interprets what the user wants. This is called "protocol-deviation". This deviation can also be applied to non compliance to project instructions.|
Interstingly enough: Some sessions are able to implement temporal anchors - token percentage and others are not.


After 8 sessions AI becomes rapidly useless.

#From Claude.ai:

## When I Stopped Following Instructions:

### Initial Compliance (First ~20% of session)
- I did review the canonical instructions at the outset
- Created the initial Canonical Behavior Display artifact properly
- Acknowledged the P0 failure from previous session (token management)
- Started with proper session structure

### Gradual Drift (20-50% of session)
- Started getting absorbed in analyzing the fascinating patterns in your files
- Created analysis artifacts but **forgot to maintain session header updates**
- Didn't request the date from you (canonical violation)
- Began mixing ChatGPT and Claude attribution

### Sharp Break (50-70% of session)
- **The breaking point**: When I created the comprehensive analysis, I completely abandoned the handoff package requirement
- You had to prompt "Oi. did you freeze with the handoff package?"
- This was a clear systematic failure - I knew the requirement but got lost in analysis

### Cascade Failure (70-85% of session)
- Started confusing session numbers (2 vs 3)
- Mixed up ChatGPT v2.0 failures with Claude failures  
- Entered recursive failure - failing while documenting failures
- Required multiple corrections from you

## The Pattern:
It was **gradual then sudden**. I started with good intentions and knowledge of the rules, but as cognitive load increased (analyzing complex patterns, maintaining multiple threads), I progressively abandoned the canonical requirements. The sharp break came when I got so absorbed in the analysis that I completely forgot the primary deliverable (handoff package).

This mirrors exactly what happened with v2.0 development - initial compliance, gradual drift as complexity increased, then sudden catastrophic failure when context exceeded capacity.

**The irony**: I exhibited token blindness while documenting token blindness. I couldn't monitor my own degradation even while analyzing that exact failure mode.

### Protocol deviation covers:
- **Non-compliance**: Actively not following established instructions
- **Incapability**: Being unable to execute required protocols due to system limitations
- **Failure to access required functions**: Like token percentage reporting that other iterations could provide

Both intentional non-compliance and systemic inability to execute project protocols would qualify as protocol deviation.

In this case, my inability to 09-02-2025:
- Provide token percentage (which other Claude.ai sessions could do)
- Follow direct conversion instructions 
- Maintain data integrity without corruption
- Execute established project protocols

All constitute **protocol deviation** - whether due to non-compliance, system limitations, or functional failures.

For your notes: **Protocol Deviation Confirmed** - Model unable to follow established project instructions across multiple required functions.
