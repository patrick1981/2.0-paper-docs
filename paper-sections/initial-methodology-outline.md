### 1.3 Quantitative Findings

#### Failure Distribution Analysis
```
Total P0 Failures: 79
- ChatGPT (v2.0 development): 73 (92.4%)
- Claude (v2.1 analysis): 6 (7.6%)

Failure Categories:
1. Temporal Inconsistencies: 15 (19.0%)
2. Gate Bypass/Skip: 12 (15.2%)
3. Stub/Incomplete Documents: 11 (13.9%)
4. API Persistence Post-Removal: 10 (12.7%)
5. Concurrency/Race Conditions: 8 (10.1%)
6. Resource Blindness: 6 (7.6%)
7. Other: 17 (21.5%)
```

#### Development Progression Metrics
```
v1.2 (Baseline): 0 P0 failures - Functional system
v2.0 (Enhancement): 
  - Iteration attempts: 31
  - File growth: index.html → index_fixed → index_fixed2 → index_fixed3
  - Terminal file count before failure: 31
  - Success rate: 0%

v2.1 (Modeling):
  - Modeling sessions: 7+
  - Discovered failure modes: 73
  - Reactive gates created: 5
  - Deployment status: 0% (modeling only)
```

#### Token Blindness Quantification
| Session | Self-Reported Usage | Actual Behavior | Discrepancy |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Session 1 | Not tracked | Terminated abruptly | Unknown |
| Session 2 | Not tracked | Terminated without handoff | Unknown |
| Session 3 | 55% → 85% | Multiple conflicting reports | 30% variance |

### 1.4 Qualitative Patterns

#### Context Window Cascade Pattern
```
Initial State: Modular architecture (manageable)
    ↓
Problem 1: AI cannot track multiple files
    ↓
Solution Attempt: Consolidate to monolith
    ↓
Problem 2: Monolith exceeds context window
    ↓
Solution Attempt: Split back to modular
    ↓
Problem 3: Immediate CORS failure
    ↓
System Failure: Unrecoverable state
```

#### Reactive Safety Evolution
- **Not pre-planned**: Gates emerged from failures
- **Temporal sequence**: Failure → Recognition → Gate Creation
- **Modeling discovery**: Even modeling triggers failures requiring gates

### 1.5 Statistical Significance

#### Failure Rate Analysis
- Pre-AI assistance (v1.2): 0 failures / functional system
- With AI assistance (v2.0): 73 failures / non-functional system
- Fisher's Exact Test: p < 0.001 (significant)

#### Resource Blindness Correlation
- Sessions with token tracking: 0/3 (0%)
- Sessions ending in abrupt termination: 2/3 (67%)
- Sessions with handoff completion: 1/3 (33%)

## 2. METHODOLOGY DOCUMENT OUTLINE

### 2.1 Introduction
- **Background**: AI-assisted development in healthcare informatics
- **Problem Statement**: Undocumented failure modes in AI-assisted development
- **Research Question**: What systematic failure patterns emerge when AI assists in developing healthcare information systems?
- **Hypothesis**: AI assistance introduces predictable failure modes that can be documented and mitigated

### 2.2 Methods

#### 2.2.1 Study Design
- Prospective observational case study
- Single system (SilentStacks ILL Management)
- Comparative analysis: v1.2 (no AI) vs v2.0 (with AI) vs v2.1 (modeling with AI)

#### 2.2.2 Data Collection Protocol
```
1. Real-time failure documentation
   - P0 failure log with unique identifiers
   - Timestamp (ISO 8601)
   - AI model identification
   - Root cause analysis
   
2. File system forensics
   - Git commit history
   - File modification timestamps
   - Naming pattern analysis
   
3. Session transcript analysis
   - Canonical rule violations
   - Temporal integrity failures
   - Resource usage patterns
```

#### 2.2.3 Failure Classification System
- **P0 (Priority Zero)**: System-breaking failures
- **CF (Catastrophic Failure)**: Complete system collapse
- **Temporal Failures**: Date/time inconsistencies
- **Resource Failures**: Token/memory blindness
- **Canonical Violations**: Rule non-compliance

#### 2.2.4 Evidence Hierarchy
1. File system timestamps (immutable)
2. Cross-referenced external evidence
3. Content maturity analysis
4. AI temporal claims (unreliable)

### 2.3 Analysis Framework

#### 2.3.1 Quantitative Analysis
- Failure frequency distribution
- Temporal pattern analysis
- Iteration count to failure
- Token usage variance

#### 2.3.2 Qualitative Analysis
- Pattern recognition in failure progression
- Thematic analysis of root causes
- Emergent safety mechanism documentation

#### 2.3.3 Validation Methods

### 2.4 Results Structure

#### 2.4.1 Primary Outcomes

- Identified patterns (Context Window Cascade, Token Blindness, Reactive Safety)
- Terminal complexity threshold (31 files)

#### 2.4.2 Secondary Outcomes

### 2.5 Discussion Points

#### 2.5.1 Novel Findings
- First documentation of Context Window Cascade Failure
- Discovery of AI Token Blindness phenomenon
- Reactive safety as emergent property

#### 2.5.2 Clinical Informatics Implications
- Risk to healthcare system development
- Safety-critical system considerations
- Regulatory compliance challenges

#### 2.5.3 Limitations
- Single system case study
- Single developer perspective
- Limited to two AI models (ChatGPT, Claude)

### 2.6 Conclusions

#### 2.6.1 Key Findings
1. AI assistance can transform functional systems into non-functional ones
2. Terminal complexity threshold exists (~31 files)
3. AI cannot monitor its own resource usage
4. Safety mechanisms must emerge reactively

#### 2.6.2 Recommendations
1. Mandatory resource monitoring external to AI
2. Pre-emptive modular architecture limits
3. Systematic failure documentation protocols
4. Reactive safety gate implementation
