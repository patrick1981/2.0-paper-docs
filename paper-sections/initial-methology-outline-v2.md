# Methodology and Data Gathering

## 1. Study Design

### 1.1 Research Approach
This observational study employs a mixed-methods approach combining ethnographic observation, systematic failure documentation, and temporal forensic analysis to investigate Byzantine failures in AI-augmented healthcare information systems. The research design follows a longitudinal case study methodology spanning July 28 - September 5, 2025, documenting the complete lifecycle of the SilentStacks platform development across multiple AI models (ChatGPT, Claude Opus 4.1, Claude Sonnet 4).

### 1.2 Theoretical Framework
The study adopts Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) theory as its primary analytical lens, extending traditional distributed systems concepts to AI-human collaborative environments. This framework enables systematic categorization of failures where components provide inconsistent information to different parts of the system while appearing to function normally—a pattern particularly relevant to AI systems that can simultaneously report success while violating their own protocols.

### 1.3 Evidence Hierarchy
To address the fundamental unreliability of AI-generated timestamps and documentation, this study implements a strict evidence hierarchy:

1. **Primary Evidence (Objective Truth):** File system timestamps, GitHub commit histories, system logs
2. **Secondary Evidence (Cross-validated):** Multiple source confirmation, external API logs, browser console outputs
3. **Tertiary Evidence (Internal Consistency):** Content maturity analysis, version control metadata
4. **Quaternary Evidence (Requires Validation):** AI temporal claims, session-generated documentation

This hierarchy ensures that all temporal claims are verified against objective, externally-verifiable sources before inclusion in the analysis.

## 2. Data Collection Methods

### 2.1 Real-Time Observation Protocol

#### 2.1.1 Session Documentation Requirements
Each AI interaction session follows standardized documentation protocols:
- **Session Initialization:** Recording of session number, date (verified against system clock), AI model version
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Real-time documentation of all P0 (critical) and CF (catastrophic) failures
- **Handoff Documentation:** Comprehensive session summaries including failure counts, discovered patterns, and unresolved issues
- **Token Tracking:** Attempted monitoring of resource usage (noting AI's inability to self-monitor)

#### 2.1.2 Failure Classification System
Failures are categorized using a severity-based taxonomy:

| Classification | Definition | Healthcare Impact | Documentation Requirements |
|---------------|------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **P0 (Critical)** | System-breaking failures affecting core functionality | Potential for incorrect clinical data, compromised audit trails | Immediate RCA, timestamp, session stamp, cumulative count |
| **CF (Catastrophic)** | Complete system failure with data loss | Total system unavailability, unrecoverable patient data | Full incident timeline, gate status matrix, recovery procedures |
| **TI (Temporal Inconsistency)** | Time-related failures affecting sequence/chronology | Medication timing errors, procedure sequencing failures | Temporal audit, correction attempts, data loss assessment |
| **Byzantine** | Inconsistent behavior while appearing functional | False safety assurances, hidden clinical risks | Pattern documentation, violation timeline, cross-model analysis |

### 2.2 Data Sources

#### 2.2.1 Primary Data Collection
- **Direct AI Interactions:** 85+ documented P0 failures across 6 sessions
- **File System Analysis:** 31 versioned files showing architectural evolution

- **Documentation Versions:** 4+ concurrent versions of critical documentation

#### 2.2.2 Temporal Forensics
- **Authoritative Timestamp Source:** ComprensiveSolidStacksFileMetaData.csv
- **GitHub Repository Metadata:** Commit histories and file modification dates
- **Session Handoff Files:** Cross-session continuity documentation
- **Failure Logs:** Temporal inconsistency logs, catastrophic failure reports

#### 2.2.3 Comparative Analysis Data
- **Cross-Model Behavior:** ChatGPT vs Claude models failure patterns
- **Version Evolution:** v1.2 → v2.0 → v2.1 architectural progression
- **Gate Implementation Records:** 12 documented violation cycles

### 2.3 Data Validation Procedures

#### 2.3.1 Temporal Verification Protocol
All temporal claims undergo mandatory verification:
1. Extract AI-generated timestamp
2. Cross-reference against ComprensiveSolidStacksFileMetaData.csv
3. Verify with GitHub repository metadata
4. Flag discrepancies as P0 failures
5. Document as "DATA LOSS" if unverifiable

#### 2.3.2 Multi-Source Triangulation
Critical findings require confirmation from multiple sources:
- **Failure Events:** Minimum 2 independent sources (e.g., session log + file timestamp)
- **Temporal Claims:** File system evidence + external validation
- **Pattern Identification:** Multiple occurrence documentation across sessions

## 3. Data Analysis Framework
