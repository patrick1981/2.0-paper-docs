## Introduction
SilentStacks is an offline‑first, accessible request and interlibrary‑loan documentation platform. This Playbook is the canonical source of truth for documentation‑pipeline operations (docs‑only scope). All ops documents defer to this Playbook.

## Core Objectives
- Client‑only docs pipeline operations with GitHub as SSOT.
- HIPAA‑safe alignment; CT.gov policy is **linkout_only** in docs.
- Deterministic, idempotent reconciliation from chat to repo.
- Uniform headers and anchors across the canon.

## P0 Benchmarks
- Docs gates G0–G3 pass on a fresh run.
- `MANIFEST_v2.1.csv` present and current.
- `AUDIT_REPORT.md` updated this session.
- Playbook printed and approved before packaging (G4).

## Data Architecture
- Canon lives under `docs/` on the default branch.
- Modeling content must live only under `docs/modeling/`.
- Non‑docs runtime assets (index.html, sw.js, *.min.js) are **out of scope**.

## Bulk Operations
- Large doc batches use chunked reads/writes with hashing.
- Never mix runtime files with documentation ops.

## Metadata Enrichment
- All cross‑refs are explicit; anchors are stable.
- CT.gov: **linkout_only** policy is reiterated in ops docs.

## UI & Accessibility
- Documentation content includes AAA guidance where applicable.
- Accessible headings/anchors; no color‑only semantics in docs.

## Offline Support
- All doc operations tolerate flaky connectors via queue + backoff.
- Resume from `RUN_CARD.json` state.

## Export & Reporting
- Package zip is **docs‑only**; include manifest + audit.
- No runtime assets in packaging.

## Governance & Compliance
- Canonical headers enforced only for request‑table docs.
- CT.gov policy = **linkout_only** (docs).

## Operational Rules
- Idempotent inserts: add only if missing; never duplicate sections.
- Read‑only mode during connector degradation.

## Accessibility Roadmap — WCAG 2.2 AAA
- Docs that carry explicit accessibility guidance are marked in MANIFEST (aaa_accessibility=true).

## References
- See cross‑reference line at the end of each ops section.

## Worst Case Scenarios
- Use `Worst_Case_Scenarios.md` for emergency‑like cases affecting documentation.

## Documentation Layout
- Ops canon: Playbook, Spin_Up, Wind_Down, Operational_Stability, Emergency_Procedures_Docs, P0_Packaging_and_Stability_Suite.

## Operation Modes
- Mode recorded in `RUN_CARD.json` and bannered in Playbook + README.

## P0 Failure Log

- FailureLog.md
- FailurePoint.md

## Catastrophic Failure Response (v2.1)
Summary:
- Step G inline printing failures + fixes
- Missing emergency ZIP packaging + fix
- Concurrency drift + per‑doc audit requirement
- Performance degradation (≥825MB) binding to emergency wind‑down
