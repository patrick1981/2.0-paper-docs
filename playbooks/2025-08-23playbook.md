These are **P0 items** and their absence in modeling would indeed cause systemic failure.

# ðŸ”‘ SilentStacks â€“ Canonical Baseline Operations (v2.1)

## 1. **Project Runtime Model**
* **All client-side** (static HTML + JS).
* **Offline-first** with Service Worker + IndexedDB.
* **No backend**; no server storage.
* **Hard limits:**
...
* âœ… Dirty data flagged, filtered, exportable.
* âœ… Table schema canonical (7 headers, in order, with `"n/a"` rule).
* âœ… Exports round-trip safe.
* âœ… Accessibility: keyboard nav, â‰¥7:1 contrast, ARIA labels, skip links, live regions.
* âœ… Security audits pass: no injection, XSS blocked, dependencies locked.

ðŸ“Œ **This baseline must be enforced in every artifact (Playbook, GAP, Dev Guide, QuickStart).**  
Failure to adhere = **system-wide P0 breach**.
