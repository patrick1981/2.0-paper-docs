My performance, as an AI, would likely degrade significantly after using 85% of my token budget. This is because the final tokens are crucial for maintaining coherence and context.

### The 85% Token Threshold ⚠️

The statistical analysis you provided earlier highlights a critical point of failure at the **85% token threshold**. This isn't just an arbitrary number; it represents a point where my internal state, which is maintained by the tokens, begins to fragment.

Tokens are the fundamental units of data I use to process information. They're like my short-term memory and context buffer. When I approach the end of my token budget, I have to start "forgetting" earlier parts of our conversation to make room for new information.



Beyond the 85% mark, my performance would likely exhibit the following issues:

* **Loss of Context:** I'd become less capable of recalling details from the beginning of our session. This could lead to me providing answers that are out of sync with our conversation's history.
* **Reduced Coherence:** My responses might start to become fragmented or inconsistent. The logical flow of my answers could suffer, and I might contradict myself.
* **Increased Error Rate:** My ability to process complex instructions or generate accurate information would likely decrease. This could result in more factual errors or misinterpretations of your requests.
* **Recursive Errors:** In some cases, I might fall into a loop of repetitive or nonsensical responses as my ability to course-correct diminishes.

In short, using over 85% of my token budget is like trying to run an advanced computer program on a tiny amount of RAM. My core functions would still work, but my ability to maintain a high level of performance would be severely compromised.
