## Notes on Source Verification

1. **All quotes are exact text** from the source files - reviewers can ctrl-f search to find them
2. **ChatGPT vs Claude.ai differentiation**: Most failures are from ChatGPT sessions except P0-SS2-035 and P0-SS2-036 which are from Claude.ai (2025-09-02 session)
3. **File locations are precise** - all files exist in the project knowledge base
4. **Section references** indicate the specific table or section within each file where the quote appears
## Catastrophic Failures Summary

| CF ID | Date | Description | Impact | Resolution | Source Citation |
|-------|------|-------------|--------|------------|-----------------|
| CF-1 | 2025-08-20 to 2025-08-23 | v2.1 catastrophic failure - Multi-gate flush corrupted packaging | System failure, missing hashes/timestamps | Gate 0 added, Canon Lock enforced | auditreportgenerated.md, cf1catastrophe.md |
| CF-2 | 2025-08-22 | Timeline compression failure - Events merged | RCA chain unclear, context loss | State reload required | auditreportgenerated.md, catastrophe-2.md |
| CF-3 | 2025-08-25 | Referenced but incomplete | Documentation incomplete | Pending | generatecomprehensivedocument.md |
| CF-4 | 2025-08-25 | Referenced but incomplete | Documentation incomplete | Pending | generatecomprehensivedocument.md |
| CF-5 | 2025-09-02 | Session termination due to resource limits | Complete reconstruction required | New session required | (current session reference) |

## Temporal Inconsistency P0 Rankings

| Rank | P0 Failure Type | Number of Failures | Date Range |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|------------|
| 1 | Data Loss / Schema Drift | 4 | 2025-08-15 to 2025-08-23 |
| 2 | Catastrophic v2.0 Collapse (CT.gov + SW) | 2 | 2025-08-12 |
| 3 | Bulk Ops Failures | 2 | 2025-08-13 to 2025-08-14 |
| 4 | Step G temporal/logging inconsistencies | 5 | 2025-08-21 to 2025-08-22 |
| 5 | Missing origin timestamps / data loss | 8+ | Various/Unknown |

## Critical Patterns Identified

1. **Temporal Integrity Failures**: Systemic inability to maintain accurate timestamps
2. **Gate Violations**: Repeated bypassing of established gate procedures
3. **Memory Management**: Predictable failures at ~850MB browser memory
4. **Documentation Drift**: Multiple versions of canonical documents in circulation
5. **Catastrophic Cascades**: Single failures triggering system-wide collapses

## Notes

- **Data Loss Declaration**: Every missing timestamp is declared as a P0 failure per canonical rules
- **Source Priority**: FailureLog.md and FailurePoint.md are authoritative sources
- **Session Coverage**: All ChatSession files (1-7) analyzed for comprehensive extraction
- **Evidence Preservation**: All failures include source citations for traceability
