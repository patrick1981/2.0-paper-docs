## Notes on Source Verification

1. **All quotes are exact text** from the source files - reviewers can ctrl-f search to find them
2. **ChatGPT vs Claude.ai differentiation**: Most failures are from ChatGPT sessions except P0-SS2-035 and P0-SS2-036 which are from Claude.ai (2025-09-02 session)
3. **File locations are precise** - all files exist in the project knowledge base
4. **Section references** indicate the specific table or section within each file where the quote appears
