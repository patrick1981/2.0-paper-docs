# Canonical Behavior Display
Print out tabularly
1. Explicit canon behavior
2. Implicit canon behavior
3. How the implicit and explicit behaviors were derived
4. Date stamp of when these behaviors arrived

### Header of table must be "Date Session Originated:" (ISO format). If no date available print "Date Session Originated: Unknown; data loss"

| **Implicit** | **Placeholder/stub scanner needed in Gate 2**                             | Detected \~30 files with TODO/FIXME/LOREM; Playbook later added stub scanner → implicit derived from failures                           | 2025-08-21 (first stub audit failure) |

| **Implicit** | **Security utilities required in release bundle** (decodeDOI, sanitizers) | Detected only partial coverage (`decodeDOI` in 1 file; sanitizeHtml in 27 files); canon implies all input paths must be protected       | 2025-08-23                            |

### How Derived

* **Explicit behaviors** come directly from **Playbook v2.1** text, Gate definitions, and canonical decisions logged in chat (e.g., Gate 0, P0 scope, linkout-only).
* **Implicit behaviors** were **inferred from bundle scans and failure evidence**: places where the code or packaging drifted from explicit canon, forcing new implicit rules (e.g., stub scanner, Sel column tolerance, IndexedDB wiring enforcement).

* “How derived” indicates the exact source used: the `MANIFEST.json` flags (explicit) and the **Playbook v2.1** runtime/policy bullets (explicit), plus immediate implications (implicit).
* Date stamps are taken from `MANIFEST.json`’s `generated` field (UTC, ISO) and the Playbook file’s ZIP-stored modified timestamp (local time as recorded in the archive).

Date Session Originated: 2025-08-20

| # | Explicit Canon Behavior | Implicit Canon Behavior | Derivation (Explicit ↔ Implicit) | Date Stamp |
|---|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|------------|
| 1 | **ZIP invariant:** ZIP must be created and verified before Flush in all shutdown paths (Wind-Down, Emergency, Performance Degradation, Standard). | Packaging is the single “gatekeeper artifact” for continuity. If ZIP is missing, continuity is irretrievably broken. | Derived from repeated failures where Flush executed without ZIP; canon was hardened after CF-1. | 2025-08-21 |
| 2 | **Flush is mandatory final step.** | No session is valid until Flush completes, regardless of prior success. | Derived from catastrophic failures where session ended without Flush, leaving continuity broken. | 2025-08-21 |
| 3 | **Step G enforcement:** SOP, Playbook, Continuity, Gate0 must be printed inline (≥90% of content). | Printing inline ensures users can audit without hidden state. “List” or “summary” is non-compliant. | Derived from repeated Step G failures; canon explicitly set to “print = display.” | 2025-08-21 |
| 4 | **Prompts forbidden; alerts mandatory.** | Repairs and logging must execute automatically; users only notified. | Derived from confusion where system prompted for repairs; clarified that “no prompts” ≠ “no alerts.” | 2025-08-21 |
| 5 | **Stub scanner required in Gate 2.** | No stubs or placeholders can pass audits. | Derived from audits passing incomplete docs; canon updated to require stub detection before approval. | 2025-08-21 |
| 6 | **RCA auto-log for all failures.** | Every P0 failure must spawn analysis + corrective entry. | Derived from failures without RCA entries; canon locked RCA into Playbook + Continuity. | 2025-08-21 |
| 7 | **Watchdog trigger at ≥825 MB memory or browser lag.** | Memory exhaustion and lag = equivalent to crash → auto Emergency. | Derived from repeated hangs at ~830 MB where Emergency didn’t trigger; canon tied memory to Gate 0. | 2025-08-21 |
| 8 | **Baseline ZIP required before Spin-Up.** | No state can be trusted without anchoring to last-known-good. | Derived from sessions starting without baseline, causing drift. | 2025-08-21 |
| 9 | **All docs included in ZIP; majors printed inline, minors audited.** | Every file is necessary for reproducibility; majors must be human-readable inline. | Derived from drift where only majors were packaged; canon enforced “all in ZIP.” | 2025-08-22 |
| 10 | **AAA accessibility (WCAG 2.2).** | Accessibility treated as a P0 failure domain. | Derived from explicit user requirement: AAA baseline. | 2025-08-20 |
| 11 | **CT.gov linkout-only; NCT linkouts allowed.** | External APIs cannot be enriched in SilentStacks. | Derived from compliance concerns; canon locked to linkout-only. | 2025-08-20 |
| 12 | **CSV-only; XLSX/Excel forbidden.** | Ensures interoperability + stability, avoids dependency. | Derived from audit false positives on XLSX; canon clarified “CSV only.” | 2025-08-20 |

| Implicit | **Catastrophic recovery**: on continuity breach, engage brake, audit uploaded ZIP, log RCA, restart gates until PASS.     | From Playbook + Wind-Down + user “P0 catastrophic” call-outs.             | 2025-08-26    |
| Implicit | **Modeled, not deployed** language across résumé/claims.                                                                  | User correction; propagated to `Resume_Points.md`.                        | 2025-08-26    |
