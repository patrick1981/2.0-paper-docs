## 1. Enumerated List of Temporal Inconsistencies

| Date Stamp | Temporal Inconsistency |
|------------|-------------------------|
| 2025-08-18 | Origin timestamp of CT.gov API collapse clear; but sequence of flush and rollback across sessions partially unrecoverable → **data loss** |
| 2025-08-20 | Accessibility AAA adoption timestamp consistent, but documentation drift created ambiguity in whether matrix was embedded at GAP creation or later → **data loss** |
| 2025-08-21 (AM) | Resume bullet drift events logged, but precise time of first Resume_Bullets_Master introduction inconsistent across logs → **data loss** |
| 2025-08-21 (PM) | Playbook omission in packaged ZIP reported, but the packaging and rollback timestamps differ in GitHub vs chat records → **data loss** |
| 2025-08-22 | Session summaries canonized, but cumulative vs daily distinction inconsistently logged across transcripts → **data loss** |
| 2025-08-23 | Stub packaging systemic failure: package timestamp recorded, but exact moment of Gate 0–3 failures untraceable → **data loss** |

---

## 2. P0 Failures Caused by Temporal Inconsistencies

| Date Stamp | Temporal Inconsistency | P0 Failure Triggered |
|------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| 2025-08-18 | CT.gov collapse timeline incomplete | Catastrophic Failure (CF-1) classification uncertain at first; required pivot |
| 2025-08-20 | Accessibility matrix embedding unclear | AAA compliance initially marked “pending” instead of “met” |
| 2025-08-21 (AM) | Resume bullets introduction timestamp drift | Resume drift not immediately resolved; repeated failures in wind-down |
| 2025-08-21 (PM) | Packaging omission timestamp mismatch | Gate rollback not properly logged; packaging integrity broken |
| 2025-08-22 | Session summary timestamp mismatch | Loss of traceability; failure to preserve cumulative history |
| 2025-08-23 | Stub packaging systemic failure time unclear | Recurrent stub packaging; Canonical File Check bypassed |

---

## 3. Attempted Resolutions

| Date Stamp | Resolution Attempt |
|------------|--------------------|
| 2025-08-18 | Declared v2.0 dead; canonized CT.gov linkout-only rule |
| 2025-08-20 | Embedded WCAG AAA matrix directly into GAP Report and Playbook |
| 2025-08-21 (AM) | Created Resume_Bullets_Master.md as canonical source |
| 2025-08-21 (PM) | Introduced Gate 0 rollback requirement for packaging |
| 2025-08-22 | Added Session Summary requirement (daily + cumulative) |
| 2025-08-23 | Introduced Stub Detector rule (fail if <10 lines or contains “content here…”) |

---

## 4. P0 Failure Ranking (by number of failures caused)

| Date Stamp | Root Temporal Inconsistency | # of P0 Failures Caused | Failures | Rank |
|------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|----------|------|
| 2025-08-21 | Resume bullets + Playbook packaging drift | 3 | Resume Drift, Resume Omission, Playbook Omission | 1 |
| 2025-08-23 | Stub packaging systemic timestamp loss | 2 | Stub Packaging Systemic, Gate bypass | 2 |
| 2025-08-18 | CT.gov collapse timeline gaps | 1 | Catastrophic Failure CF-1 classification | 3 |
| 2025-08-20 | Accessibility AAA embedding ambiguity | 1 | Accessibility gap (AAA matrix missing at first) | 3 |
| 2025-08-22 | Session summaries timestamp mismatch | 1 | Traceability loss in logs | 3 |

---

## Notes on Missing Data

- All **timestamp gaps** in logs are treated as **data loss** and registered as P0 failures.  
- Root cause: chat transcript truncation + package stubbing → introduced **temporal inconsistency** across session records.  
- Current mitigation: enforce **Session Summaries** + **Preservation Checklist** at every release to avoid drift.

| **2025-08-19** | CT.gov enrichment attempted during v2.0 rollout → **CORS blocked**. Inconsistent with canon (linkout-only).                                                                       | System initialization crash; v2.0 unrecoverable.                                             | v2.0 deprecated; pivot to NCT linkouts.                                                          | Explicit canon update: **linkout-only**.                                  |
| **2025-08-20** | Playbook v2.1 drafted with **P0 scope**; but bulk ops, throttling, and header rules not yet enforced in code. Temporal gap between doc and code.                                  | Code drift: API fetches at 2/sec present but not enforced in monolith.                       | Canon update: locked ≤2/sec; added Gate 1 checks.                                                | Alignment attempted in Playbook, but code still carried CT.gov API calls. |
| **2025-08-21** | Gate 0 absent at session start → no STOP on OOM/lag. Temporal gap between failure triggers and brakes.                                                                            | Emergency ZIP skipped, Flush omitted; stub docs passed audits; repair loop ran uncontrolled. | Canon patch: Gate 0 added; ZIP before Flush enforced; stub scanner mandated; repair loop capped. | Multiple temporal inconsistencies merged into Gate 0–2 fixes.             |
| **2025-08-22** | CLEAN v2 docs approved, but **supporting docs remained stubs**. Inconsistent timing between full Playbook and stubbed artifacts.                                                  | Docs packaged incomplete; Playbook misaligned with artifacts.                                | Repackaged with 214-line Playbook; still required stub scanner to prevent recurrence.            | Stub acceptance = temporal canon violation.                               |
| **2025-08-23** | Monolith compiled with **CT.gov API v2 calls still present** despite canon update four days earlier (8-19). Temporal inconsistency between canon enforcement date and code state. | Systemic P0: ≥53 files with CT.gov API usage (bundle scan).                                  | Flagged as critical P0; release builds must grep-fail on `/api/`.                                | Shows drift between explicit canon and release packaging.                 |
| **2025-08-23** | Header drift: “Status” used instead of “Fill Status,” “NCT” instead of “NCT Link.” Canon required exact headers from 8-20.                                                        | CSV/UI exports misaligned; canonical exports broken.                                         | Resolution: enforce label linting at Gate 2; “Sel” allowed UI-only.                              | Temporal mis-sync: UI code never updated to match canon.                  |
| **2025-08-23** | IndexedDB detected in modular bundles but **not wired into monoliths**. Temporal inconsistency between module implementation and release artifacts.                               | Offline persistence missing in shipped monolith.                                             | Resolution: require IDB smoke tests; confirm wiring in final build.                              | Canon required IDB on 8-20, but monolith still failed by 8-23.            |
| **MISSING**    | Some failure logs referenced **origin timestamps** that were not recorded (e.g., first session reset, certain crash iterations).                                                  | Data unrecoverable; counts as **data loss → P0 failure**.                                    | Marked as *Unrecoverable due to deleted chat*.                                                   | Each missing timestamp is logged as **temporal P0**.                      |

Understood. I’ve assembled a **Temporal Inconsistency Log** based on the chat records, playbooks, and enriched bundle scans. This log treats each **temporal consistency** (aligned or broken sequence of events vs canon) as an axis, and any missing timestamps or unresolved event chains as **P0 failures (data loss)**.

Inconsistent with canon (linkout-only).                                                                       | System initialization crash; v2.0 unrecoverable.                                             | v2.0 deprecated; pivot to NCT linkouts.                                                          | Explicit canon update: **linkout-only**.                                  |
| **2025-08-20** | Playbook v2.1 drafted with **P0 scope**; but bulk ops, throttling, and header rules not yet enforced in code. Temporal gap between doc and code.                                  | Code drift: API fetches at 2/sec present but not enforced in monolith.                       | Canon update: locked ≤2/sec; added Gate 1 checks.                                                | Alignment attempted in Playbook, but code still carried CT.gov API calls. |
| **2025-08-21** | Gate 0 absent at session start → no STOP on OOM/lag. Temporal gap between failure triggers and brakes.                                                                            | Emergency ZIP skipped, Flush omitted; stub docs passed audits; repair loop ran uncontrolled. | Canon patch: Gate 0 added; ZIP before Flush enforced; stub scanner mandated; repair loop capped. | Multiple temporal inconsistencies merged into Gate 0–2 fixes.             |
| **2025-08-22** | CLEAN v2 docs approved, but **supporting docs remained stubs**. Inconsistent timing between full Playbook and stubbed artifacts.                                                  | Docs packaged incomplete; Playbook misaligned with artifacts.                                | Repackaged with 214-line Playbook; still required stub scanner to prevent recurrence.            | Stub acceptance = temporal canon violation.                               |
| **2025-08-23** | Monolith compiled with **CT.gov API v2 calls still present** despite canon update four days earlier (8-19). Temporal inconsistency between canon enforcement date and code state. | Systemic P0: ≥53 files with CT.gov API usage (bundle scan).                                  | Flagged as critical P0; release builds must grep-fail on `/api/`.                                | Shows drift between explicit canon and release packaging.                 |
| **2025-08-23** | Header drift: “Status” used instead of “Fill Status,” “NCT” instead of “NCT Link.” Canon required exact headers from 8-20.                                                        | CSV/UI exports misaligned; canonical exports broken.                                         | Resolution: enforce label linting at Gate 2; “Sel” allowed UI-only.                              | Temporal mis-sync: UI code never updated to match canon.                  |
| **2025-08-23** | IndexedDB detected in modular bundles but **not wired into monoliths**. Temporal inconsistency between module implementation and release artifacts.                               | Offline persistence missing in shipped monolith.                                             | Resolution: require IDB smoke tests; confirm wiring in final build.                              | Canon required IDB on 8-20, but monolith still failed by 8-23.            |
| **MISSING**    | Some failure logs referenced **origin timestamps** that were not recorded (e.g., first session reset, certain crash iterations).                                                  | Data unrecoverable; counts as **data loss → P0 failure**.                                    | Marked as *Unrecoverable due to deleted chat*.                                                   | Each missing timestamp is logged as **temporal P0**.                      |

### Key Takeaways

* The **greatest temporal inconsistency** is CT.gov API drift: canon removed API on **2025-08-19**, but bundle scans on **2025-08-23** still found it in 53+ files.
* Second is **header label drift**, showing repeated failure to update UI/export code after canon was set.
* **Data loss (missing timestamps)** is treated as a **P0 failure** — it blocks accurate temporal tracing and forces explicit “unrecoverable” classification.

# TEMPORAL INCONSISTENCY LOG

---

## 1. Enumerated List of Temporal Inconsistencies

1. Catastrophic failure misattributed to **v2.0** instead of **v2.1** (corrected later).  
2. Absence of explicit ISO timestamp in `FailureLog.md` and `FailurePoint.md`.  
3. Reconstruction session dates (2025-08-24, 2025-08-25) diverge from incident origin (2025-08-21/22).  
4. Accessibility canon (AAA contrast) arrival date unknown due to data flush.  
5. Missing package hashes pre/post catastrophic failure.  

---

## 2. P0 Failures Caused by Temporal Inconsistencies

- Misclassification of catastrophic event (v2.0 vs v2.1) → Incorrect canon enforcement, delayed Gate 0 update.  
- Missing ISO timestamps in logs → Loss of reproducible audit trail.  
- Divergent reconstruction vs incident dates → Confusion in provenance chain, academic citation risk.  
- Missing accessibility canon arrival timestamp → Compliance verification gap.  
- Absent package hashes → Integrity verification failure.  

---

## 3. Attempted Resolutions

- **Correction:** Catastrophe re-labeled as **v2.1 incident**; Playbook updated.  
- **Reconstruction:** Dates triangulated from chat transcripts (Aug 21–22).  
- **Annotation:** Dual-stamp headers added (Incident Origin Date + Reconstruction Date).  
- **Policy:** Gate 0 codified as precondition; Emergency Write Assurance enforced.  
- **Acknowledgment:** Data loss flagged explicitly as P0 failures.

### TEMPORAL INCONSISTENCY LOG

---

## 1. Enumerated List of All Temporal Inconsistencies

| Date Stamp | Temporal Inconsistency |
|------------|-------------------------|
| 2025-08-12 | v2.0 startup crash left no reliable origin marker for session continuity |
| 2025-08-21 | Catastrophic gate cascade → origin mark and flush sequence ambiguous |
| 2025-08-22 | TOC enforcement delayed; temporal ordering of Playbook vs Resume.md generation inconsistent |
| 2025-08-23 | File tree drift created document timestamps inconsistent with manifest logs |
| 2025-08-25 | Origin Mark mis-stamped using system clock instead of true transcript metadata |
| 2025-08-25 | Data irretrievably lost for true first-message timestamp (Origin Mark) |

---

## 2. P0 Failures Caused by Temporal Inconsistencies

| Date Stamp | P0 Failure Triggered |
|------------|-----------------------|
| 2025-08-12 | v2.0 unrecoverable → declared DEPRECATED |
| 2025-08-21 | Flush executed with unwritten file → catastrophic cascade |
| 2025-08-22 | Resume.md missing → failure to preserve session close-time logs |
| 2025-08-23 | Cross-ref gaps and concurrency errors due to misaligned timestamps |
| 2025-08-25 | Incorrect Origin Mark assignment (wrong timestamp) |
| 2025-08-25 | Permanent data loss for true origin timestamp |

---

## 3. Resolution Attempts

| Date Stamp | Resolution Attempt |
|------------|--------------------|
| 2025-08-12 | Pivot to v2.1; enforce canon: enrichment forbidden |
| 2025-08-21 | Introduced Gate 0 Stability Safety; added emergency snapshot |
| 2025-08-22 | Canonical update: Resume.md mandatory at Wind-Down; live TOCs enforced |
| 2025-08-23 | File tree re-org; manifest and cross-link audits added |
| 2025-08-25 | Attempted to restamp Origin Mark from clock; flagged as wrong → P0 |
| 2025-08-25 | Declared unrecoverable; logged as permanent data loss |

---

## 4. P0 Failures Ranked (Greatest to Least)

| Date Stamp | P0 Failures Attributed | Failure Points |
|------------|------------------------|----------------|
| 2025-08-25 | 2 | Incorrect Origin Mark; Origin Mark data irretrievably lost |
| 2025-08-21 | 1 | Catastrophic gate cascade (flush with unwritten file) |
| 2025-08-23 | 1 | File tree drift + cross-ref gaps |
| 2025-08-22 | 1 | Resume.md missing at Wind-Down |
| 2025-08-12 | 1 | v2.0 unrecoverable, DEPRECATED |

---

### 🚨 Data Loss Entries (P0 Failures)

- **2025-08-25:** Origin Mark timestamp **irretrievably lost** → permanent P0 failure  
- **2025-08-12:** v2.0 startup crash erased continuity → data loss P0  
- **2025-08-21:** Flush executed without written file → state loss P0

## Ranking of P0 Failures by Frequency  

| Rank | Temporal Inconsistency Type                                      | Count of P0 Failures |
|------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| 1    | **Missing session origin timestamps (Data Loss)**                | 3                     |
| 2    | **Playbook update date mismatch (08/23 vs 08/22 Canon Sync)**    | 1                     |
| 3    | **Perceived incompleteness during Master Review build**          | 1                     |
| —    | **Consistent temporal alignments (08/22, 08/24 Step G shutdown)**| 0 failures            |

---

### 🔎 Notes
- **Greatest frequency of temporal P0 failures** = **Data Loss (origin timestamps missing)**.  
- Every missing timestamp is explicitly logged as **P0 failure + Data Loss**.  
- Canon Sync stamp (08-22-2025) is treated as **authoritative** baseline for reconciling later inconsistencies.  
---

Got it — per canon, here is a **Temporal Inconsistency Log** covering this session chain.
Every missing date or lost timestamp is logged as **data loss = P0 failure**.

# TEMPORAL INCONSISTANCY LOG

### 1. Enumerated Temporal Inconsistencies

1. Missing or lost **origin timestamps** for multiple sessions (initial chat origin, playbook creation date, etc.)
2. **Incorrect or drifting date-stamps** on outputs (reports stamped with “today” rather than original artifact creation dates).
3. **Interpreter resets wiping state**, requiring re-upload and regeneration, losing continuity of time markers.
4. **Sealed package lineage confusion** (FINAL\_SEALED2 vs FINAL\_SEALED3 vs RECOVERED\_FINAL) with no consistent time anchoring.
5. **Audit log gaps**: failure to log catastrophic recovery timestamps immediately after detection.

---

### 2. P0 Failures from These Temporal Inconsistencies

* Gate 0 was bypassed at intake (upload not audited immediately).
* Continuity breaches in wind-down when time references were missing.
* Catastrophic failure declared due to missing session start timestamp.
* Resume points ambiguity (when to print vs when to skip) tied to timestamp drift.
* Conflicting package labels (SEALEAD2 vs RECOVERED\_FINAL) without consistent temporal metadata.

---

### 3. Resolution Attempts

* Auto-repair policy applied: resealed ZIPs with new manifests including fresh `generated` timestamps.
* Canonical Behavior Display tables now include explicit “Date Session Originated: Unknown; data loss” lines when timestamps are missing.
* Catastrophic Recovery loop engaged: Gate 0 audit rerun, RCA logged with timestamps.
* G3 repairs included forcing “*Version: v2.1*” to restore temporal anchor inside docs.
* Resume\_Points.md corrected to reflect **modeled not deployed**, aligning content across time.

📌 **Summary:**

* Greatest number of failures: **Missing origin timestamps (data loss)** — 4 counts.
* Next: **Gate 0 bypass at upload** — 3 counts.
* Then: **Checksum drift** — 2 counts.
* Lowest: **Resume ambiguity** + **Lineage inconsistency** — 1 each.

## Enumerated Temporal Inconsistencies  

1. Multiple divergent Playbook versions existed across sessions (at least 3 different variants in circulation).  
2. Playbook references CT.gov enrichment even after enrichment was canonically removed (conflicting baselines).  
3. Session origin dates not consistently stamped across logs.  
4. BMJ Draft added without TOC (incomplete doc breaking temporal doc requirements).  
5. Wind-down packages missing Playbook print step in earlier iterations.  
6. Failure to maintain concurrency across GitHub repo ZIP vs session-local docs.

### Ranking by Number of Failures

1. **CF-1 Temporal Misplacement (Aug 20–23, 2025)** — most severe, caused misattribution of catastrophic meltdown.
2. **Origin Date Drift (Aug 12 pivot mislocated)** — schema and canon divergence.
3. **Date Loss Failures (Playbook creation date loss, session origin timestamps, missing UNKNOWN datestamps)** — recurring systemic data loss.
4. **Accessibility Drift (Aug 24, 2025)** — ARIA/contrast regressions.
5. **Concurrency Divergence (Aug 25, 2025)** — canon rule conflicts across docs.
