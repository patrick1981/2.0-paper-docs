# 2. ALL CATASTROPHIC FAILURES (CF-1 through CF-X)

## CF-1 — Step G Catastrophic Melt (2025-08-12)

* **Incident Timeline**

  * 2025-08-12 14:02Z — Attempted Playbook inline print → stubs only.
  * 2025-08-12 14:05Z — Emergency flush approved simultaneously with packaging.
  * 2025-08-12 14:06Z — Browser frozen, ZIP corrupted.
  * 2025-08-12 14:10Z — Session unrecoverable.

* **Gate Status Matrix**

  | Gate | Status      | Notes                       |
  | ---- | ----------- | --------------------------- |
  | G0   | Failed      | Stability guard not engaged |
  | G1   | Failed      | Canon baseline missing      |
  | G2   | Failed      | Manifest incomplete         |
  | G3   | Failed      | Regression skipped          |
  | G4   | Not reached | Playbook stub blocked       |

* **Package Hashes**

  * ZIP: corrupted, no SHA256 valid.
  * MANIFEST: DOES NOT EXIST – NEEDED.

* **Corrective Actions**

  * Gate 0 flush guard mandatory.
  * Gate 2 manifest required before flush.
  * Gate 3 regression required before packaging.
  * Step G printing chunked w/ SHA256 validation.

* **Classification/Impact/Recovery/Prevention**

  * **Classification:** P0 Catastrophic Failure.
  * **Impact:** Docs lost, unrecoverable state.
  * **Recovery:** Rehydrated from chat history + Git.
  * **Prevention:** Gate 0 flush guard, chunked prints, manifest enforcement.
