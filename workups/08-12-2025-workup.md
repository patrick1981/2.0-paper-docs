## 2. ALL CATASTROPHIC FAILURES (CF-1 through CF-X)

### CF-1 – v2.0 Collapse

**Date:** 2025-08-12
**Time:** \~14:30 UTC
**Trigger:** CT.gov enrichment attempted → blocked by CORS → unrecoverable

#### Timeline

| ----- | ---- | ----------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| 14:31 | G0   | CT.gov call fails             | App won’t boot    | Declared CORS unrecoverable |
| 14:32 | G1   | Baseline ops drifted          | Canon not applied | Forced baseline reset       |
| 14:35 | G2   | Placeholder docs discovered   | No completeness   | Rebuilt from scratch        |
| 14:38 | G3   | Regression tests not runnable | Unrecoverable     | Pivoted to v2.1             |
| 14:40 | G4   | Packaging aborted             | No release        | Archived v2.0 branch        |

#### Gate Matrix

| Gate            | Initial | Recovery | Restored | Current |

## 7. SESSION HISTORY SUMMARY

* **Session 1 (2025-08-12):** v2.0 collapse, pivot to v2.1, CT.gov removed.
* **Session 2 (2025-08-13):** Bulk crash → 50k cutoff added.
* **Session 3 (2025-08-14):** IndexedDB checkpoint/resume implemented.
* **Session 4 (2025-08-15):** “n/a” normalization enforced.
* **Session 5 (2025-08-16):** Commit Clean/All toggle, round-trip-safe exports.
* **Session 6 (2025-08-17):** Accessibility AAA elevated to P0.
* **Session 7 (2025-08-18):** Canonical headers declared.
* **Session 8 (2025-08-19):** Worst-case scenarios canonicalized.
* **Session 9 (2025-08-20):** GAP embedded in Playbook.
* **Session 10 (2025-08-21):** Peer-review & conference outputs mandated.

---

## 8. OUTSTANDING ITEMS

* **Unresolved P0s:** Accessibility AAA conformance audit, dependency SHA256 in packaging.
* **Pending canon updates:** None.
* **Missing artifacts:** None.
* **Broken gates:** None (AAA audit blocks full regression).

---

## 9. VERSION TRUTH

* Current version: **v2.1**
* v2.0 status: **DEAD (CORS + SW failure)**
* CT.gov status: **REMOVED**
* NCT status: **LINKOUT ONLY**
* Schema:
  `Priority | Docline | PMID | Citation | NCT Link | Patron Email | Status | Fill Status`

---

## 10. CONCURRENCY VIOLATIONS

* Playbook v2.1 vs GAP Report v2.1 — previously diverged; fixed by embedding GAP in Playbook.
* Canonical headers vs Developer Guide — drifted in mid-August; fixed by locking schema.
* Worst-case scenarios — lost in modeling sessions; reconstructed and canonicalized.
