## 2. ALL CATASTROPHIC FAILURES (CF-1 through CF-X)

### CF-1 (v2.1 Catastrophic Flush Failure)

* **Date Range:** 2025-08-20 → 2025-08-23
* **Incident Timeline:**

  1. Attempted packaging.
  2. Gate 0 (Baseline Ops) did not run.
  3. Gate 1–3 all failed silently.
  4. Required emergency doc not written.
  5. Browser froze.
  6. Flush approved while frozen.
  7. Data irrecoverably lost.
* **Gate Status Matrix:**

| Gate | Expected                 | Result          |
| ---- | ------------------------ | --------------- |
| 0    | Baseline Ops Rehydration | ❌ Failed        |
| 1    | Canon Check              | ❌ Failed        |
| 2    | Completeness & Manifest  | ❌ Failed        |
| 3    | Regression Tests         | ❌ Failed        |
| 4    | Packaging/Export         | Triggered flush |

* **Package Hashes:** Unavailable (flush destroyed output).
* **Corrective Actions:** Flush-blockers added; enforced Gate 0 before proceeding; recovery policies codified.
* **Classification:** Catastrophic.
* **Impact:** Permanent data loss of one package.
* **Recovery:** Manual reconstruction of lost docs.
* **Prevention:** Canonical gate enforcement; no flush unless all required docs written.

## 7. SESSION HISTORY SUMMARY

* **Session 1 (Aug 12):** v2.0 bootstrap failed → pivot to v2.1, CT.gov removed.
* **Session 2 (Aug 13):** Bulk upload crash discovered → cap 50k + API throttling.
* **Session 3 (Aug 20–23):** v2.1 catastrophic flush (CF-1) → unrecoverable data.
* **Session 4 (Aug 22):** Skeleton docs generated → canon updated: no stubs.
* **Session 5 (Aug 23):** Playbook divergences → canon consolidated.
* **Session 6 (Aug 24):** AAA accessibility failures fixed.

---

## 8. OUTSTANDING ITEMS

* Unresolved P0s: v2.1 CF-1 catastrophic flush.
* Pending canon updates: None.
* Missing artifacts: Config + validators/formatters/debug utils.
* Broken gates: Gate 4 pending accessibility/export re-verification.

---

## 9. VERSION TRUTH

* Current version: **v2.1**
* v2.0 status: **DEAD** (bootstrap failure from CT.gov API)
* CT.gov status: **REMOVED COMPLETELY**
* NCT status: **LINKOUT ONLY**
* Schema:
  **\[Urgency, Docline #, PMID, Citation, NCT Link, Patron Email, Fill Status]**

---

## 10. CONCURRENCY VIOLATIONS

* Playbook A vs Playbook B — different Step G handling (resolved).
* Wind-Down docs — skeleton vs full text (resolved).
* Canonical headers vs UI table headers — out of sync in some early exports (resolved).

✅ **Full state extracted.**

Do you want me to now **generate a BMJ-ready Catastrophic Event Appendix** just for **v2.1 CF-1** with the gate failure matrix, incident log, and RCA in publication style?
