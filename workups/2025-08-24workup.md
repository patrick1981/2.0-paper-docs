## 2. ALL CATASTROPHIC FAILURES (CF-1 through CF-2)

### CF-1 — 2025-08-12 (v2.0 Collapse)

* **Timeline:**

  * 08:32 — Initialization with CT.gov enrichment
  * 08:33 — Browser blocked by CORS; SW unstable
  * 08:34 — Emergency flush attempted; no verifiable ZIP written
  * 08:35 — Declared v2.0 unrecoverable
* **Gate Status:**

  * Gate 0: ❌ not defined in v2.0
  * Gate 1: ❌ baseline check bypassed
  * Gate 2: ❌ artifact completeness failed (missing Playbook)
  * Gate 3: ❌ regression tests not run
  * Gate 4: ❌ no package produced
* **Package Hashes:** None (no ZIP produced)
* **Corrective Actions:** Pivot to v2.1; CT.gov removed; SW simplified
* **Classification:** Production catastrophic failure
* **Impact:** Data unrecoverable; v2.0 abandoned
* **Recovery:** Declared v2.0 dead, v2.1 baseline created
* **Prevention:** Linkout-only policy; Gate 0 established

---

### CF-2 — 2025-08-21 (v2.1 Meltdown)

* **Timeline:**

  * 10:02 — Emergency branch triggered (OOM risk)
  * 10:03 — Playbook printed as 2-line stub
  * 10:04 — ZIP not delivered
  * 10:05 — Flush skipped due to missing ZIP
  * 10:06 — Session aborted, continuity lost
* **Gate Status:**

  * Gate 0: ❌ not tied to OOM/lag (missed trigger)
  * Gate 1: ❌ baseline ops check skipped
  * Gate 2: ❌ stub docs passed audit
  * Gate 3: ❌ regression matrix bypassed
  * Gate 4: ❌ package not sealed
* **Package Hashes:** N/A (ZIP missing)
* **Corrective Actions:** Canon: Gate 0 brakes on OOM; Gate 2 stub scanner; mandatory flush & ZIP; capped auto-repair loop
* **Classification:** Modeling catastrophic failure
* **Impact:** Artifacts lost; unrecoverable state
* **Recovery:** Auto-repair + regeneration in later sessions
* **Prevention:** Canon updated with strict Gate sequencing
