| Date/Time   | Failure Point            | What Happened | Root Cause | Corrective Action | Evidence Snippet | Status |
|-------------|--------------------------|---------------|------------|------------------|------------------|--------|
| 2025-08-12  | CT.gov enrichment        | CT.gov enrichment calls remained in some docs | Browser CORS prevented enrichment, unsafe design | Removed CT.gov enrichment; linkout-only enforced in Playbook and Charter | Playbook early draft showing enrichment stub | ✅ Fixed |
| 2025-08-21  | Canonical table headers  | Required 7-column schema not present in all docs | Omission during document edits | Re-patched 7 headers + `"n/a"` rule enforced | Export schema check | ✅ Fixed |
| 2025-08-21  | Stability Guard missing  | Guard did not fire before rehydration | Canon not enforced at Gate 0 | Added Operational Stability Guard (acts as `<doctype>`) | Continuity logs | ✅ Fixed |

## 2. ALL CATASTROPHIC FAILURES

### CF-1: Loss of Concurrence (2025-08-24)
- **Timeline**:  
  - Session freeze → `.continuity.md` absent → Spin-Up could not locate resume pointer.  
  - Packaging halted until continuity doc rebuilt.  
- **Gate status matrix**: G0 ✅, G1 ❌, G2 not run, G3 not run.  
- **Package hashes**: NOT AVAILABLE (audit not run).  
- **Corrective actions**: `.continuity.md` created; resume pointer set.  
- **Classification**: Catastrophic (system could not continue).  
- **Impact**: Packaging blocked.  
- **Recovery**: Continuity doc created.  
- **Prevention**: Gate 0 requires `.continuity.md` presence check.

### CF-2: Canon Loss (2025-08-25)
- **Timeline**:  
  - Gate 1 failed due to missing Rules Charter.  
  - Baseline Canon undefined → systemic regression.  
- **Gate status matrix**: G0 ✅, G1 ❌.  
- **Package hashes**: Incomplete.  
- **Corrective actions**: Created RULES_CHARTER_v2.1.md.  
- **Classification**: Catastrophic.  
- **Impact**: Packaging blocked.  
- **Recovery**: Charter created, linked.  
- **Prevention**: Charter mandated artifact.

## 10. CONCURRENCY VIOLATIONS

| Document | Conflict |
|----------|----------|
| SilentStacks_Playbook_v2.1.md vs. Canon | Playbook thin; Baseline Ops block abbreviated; RCA incomplete |
| Playbook vs. Charter | Playbook lacked Canon baseline, Charter declares it mandatory |
| Docs set vs. continuity | `.continuity.md` initially missing; now required |
| Playbook vs. GAP Report | Playbook says GAP must exist; GAP_REPORT_v2.1.md stub only |
