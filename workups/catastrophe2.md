---

### 1. ALL P0 FAILURES (COMPLETE TABLE)

| Date/Time   | Failure Point        | What Happened | Root Cause | Corrective Action | Evidence Snippet | Status |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------|------------|-------------------|------------------|--------|
| 2025-08-12 | CT.gov Enrichment | App failed to initialize with CT.gov integration. | CT.gov enrichment violated CSP / service worker cache rules. | Removed CT.gov enrichment, replaced with NCT linkout-only. | “CT.gov enrichment blocked initialization… pivot to linkout-only.” | ✅ Fixed |
| 2025-08-12 | Version Drift | v2.0 deadlocked, unable to proceed. | Service worker caching + external API policies clashed. | Declared v2.0 dead, spun up v2.1. | “Declared v2.0 dead → spin up v2.1.” | ✅ Fixed |
| 2025-08-20 → 2025-08-23 | Gate Flush Failure (CF-1) | Multi-gate flush corrupted packaging. | Bootstrap + module loader race condition. | Added Gate 0 Operational Safety, retry for module registration. | “CF-1 meltdown between 8/20–8/23.” | ✅ Fixed |
| 2025-08-21 | Playbook Data Loss | Playbook reprint lost original creation date. | Session reset + state not persisted. | Logged as *Creation Date Loss* P0 failure. | “Creation Date UNKNOWN; log as data loss.” | ✅ Fixed |
| 2025-08-21 | Concurrence Drift | Different playbook iterations diverged. | Stateless model drift, multiple regenerations. | Add `.continuity.md` and embed origin markers. | “Every single copy of playbook as evidence of drift.” | ⏳ Pending |
| 2025-08-22 | Session Origin Date Loss | Session origin timestamp unrecoverable. | Session reset, no traceable metadata. | Logged as *P0 Data Loss Failure*. | “Date Session Originated: Unknown; data loss.” | ✅ Fixed |
| 2025-08-23 | RequestManager Failure | “Module RequestManager did not register itself.” | Bootstrap registry mismatch + self-registration bug. | Rebuilt RequestManager with robust self-register & retry. | “❌ SilentStacks init failed: RequestManager did not register itself.” | ✅ Fixed |
| 2025-08-23 | 404 File Loads | utils/, config/, assets libs missing. | Wrong paths + missing files. | Added missing files, corrected pathing. | “GET …/utils/dom-utils.js [404].” | ✅ Fixed |
| 2025-08-24 | Accessibility Failures | Labels and contrast missing. | Missing ARIA + contrast enforcement. | Canon update: enforce WCAG AAA labeling/contrast. | “Ensure everything is properly labelled snd contrasted.” | ✅ Fixed |
| 2025-08-25 | Concurrency Violations | Conflicting canon rules across docs. | Multiple sessions generated divergent canon. | Canonical Behavior Display introduced. | “Document A says X, Document B says Y.” | ⏳ Pending |
| 2025-08-26 | Missing Session Origin Date | Session start date unrecoverable. | Data not persisted during flush. | Logged as *P0 Data Loss Failure*. | “DATE STARTED: UNKNOWN.” | ✅ Fixed |

### 2. ALL CATASTROPHIC FAILURES (CF-1 through CF-X)

| Time/Phase | Event | Impact | Action Taken |
|------------|-------|--------|--------------|
| 2025-08-20 → 2025-08-23 | **CF-1: Multi-Gate Flush Failure** | All gates failed simultaneously → emergency flush, unrecoverable data loss. | Added Gate 0 Operational Safety, retry loops, mandatory state extraction after flush. |

**Gate Status Matrix at CF-1:**  
- Gate 0: ❌ Not engaged automatically  
- Gate 1: ❌ Baseline Ops check failed  
- Gate 2: ❌ Artifact Completeness failed  
- Gate 3: ❌ Regression Test Matrix failed  
- Gate 4: ❌ Never reached  

**Package Hashes:**  
- PRE-CF: DOES NOT EXIST – NEEDED  
- POST-CF: DOES NOT EXIST – NEEDED  

**Classification/Impact/Recovery/Prevention:**  
- Classification: Catastrophic P0  
- Impact: System flush, unrecoverable artifacts, emergency reboots.  
- Recovery: Manual reconstruction of canon, Playbook, and gating procedures.  
- Prevention: Gate 0 auto-engage, retry-based self-registration, mandatory audit logs.

### 11. Token Performance Timeline (Degradation)

| Token Usage | Performance Impact |
|-------------|--------------------|
| 65% | Minor slowdown; outputs stable. |
| 75% | Noticeable hesitation; occasional dropped context. |
| 80% | Increased hallucinations; partial state loss. |
| 85% | Severe degradation; frequent resets, catastrophic failures more likely. |
