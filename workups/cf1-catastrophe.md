# COMPLETE CURRENT STATE (MANDATORY EXTRACTION)

### 1. ALL P0 FAILURES (COMPLETE TABLE)
| Date/Time | Failure Point | What Happened | Root Cause | Corrective Action | Evidence Snippet | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2025-09-06T00:00:00-0400 | Documentation/Playbook Provenance | Original Playbook 'Originally Authored' date missing; not present in 2025-08-22 08:00 package. | Data loss / packaging omission prior to recovery; Playbook file absent in uploaded package. | Embed Provenance block; log data loss; require external provenance import; update Step-G gating. | PLAYBOOK.md shows 'Originally Authored: UNKNOWN — not present in 2025-08-22 08:00 package'. | ⏳ Pending |
| 2025-08-22T08:10:00-0400 | Emergency Packaging / Flush | Emergency ZIP returned 'file not found' and CF declared before certified bundle existed. | Browser freeze; missing finalize/verify gating; premature CF declaration. | Add ZIP_FINALIZED + SHA256_OK gate; rebuild packages; record hashes before enabling Flush/Download. | CF-1 timeline shows 08:10 fail; Step-G checklist updated; CF-1_package_hashes.csv present post-fix. | ✅ Fixed |
| 2025-09-06T00:00:00-0400 | Packaging Links / Runtime Reset | Download links issued after interpreter reset before files were re-written. | Runtime reset invalidated prior artifacts; links provided too early. | Force rewrite + hash verification before linking; display verification table. | Verification table (artifact sizes & SHA-256) shown post-rebuild. | ✅ Fixed |
| 2025-09-06T00:00:00-0400 | Packaging Clock | Non-identical build timestamps across MD and CSV during early recovery passes. | Multiple generators executed at different moments; no single run clock. | Standardize a single Build Timestamp per Step-G run. | Rebuilt packages share the same timestamp. | ✅ Fixed |
| 2025-09-06T00:00:00-0400 | Documentation Header Format | One output header lacked ISO-8601 with timezone. | Formatting gap in display function. | Enforce ISO 8601 + TZ; add policy to Playbook. | Subsequent headers use ISO 8601 with timezone. | ✅ Fixed |
| UNKNOWN — DATA LOSS | Session Origin Timestamp | Date Session Originated cannot be established from artifacts. | Historical data loss; origin not recorded in uploaded package. | Log data loss; request external provenance; stamp 'Unknown; data loss' in displays. | Canonical Behavior Display header prints 'Unknown; data loss'. | ⏳ Pending |
