## 2. ALL CATASTROPHIC FAILURES (CF-1 through CF-X)

### CF-1: v2.1 Catastrophic Failure

- **Full Incident Timeline**
  - 2025-08-21 ~15:40 ET: Large transcript loaded → memory degradation.  
  - 2025-08-21 ~16:00 ET: Gate 0 skipped → no baseline stability check.  
  - 2025-08-21 ~16:10 ET: Emergency file should have written; failed silently.  
  - 2025-08-21 ~16:15 ET: Flush routine executed → unrecoverable artifact loss.  

- **Gate Status Matrix**

| Gate | Status   | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| G0   | ❌ Failed | Session stability not validated |
| G1   | ❌ Failed | Baseline Canon Check bypassed |
| G2   | ❌ Failed | Artifact completeness not checked |
| G3   | ❌ Failed | Regression Test Matrix not run |
| G4   | ❌ Failed | Flush executed without emergency write |

- **Package Hashes**
  - Pre-failure package: DOES NOT EXIST - NEEDED  
  - Post-flush state: DOES NOT EXIST - NEEDED  

- **Corrective Actions**
  - Enforced Gate 0 as hard precondition.  
  - Emergency write-before-flush assurance added.  
  - Autosave checkpoints planned.  

- **Classification/Impact/Recovery/Prevention**
  - **Classification:** Catastrophic (all gates failed).  
  - **Impact:** Unrecoverable loss of modeling artifacts (playbook edits, RCA deltas).  
  - **Recovery:** Reconstructed from archived .md files + Chat.txt transcripts.  
  - **Prevention:** Gate 0 halts, atomic writes, autosave snapshots, session watchdog.

## 6. ALL RCA ENTRIES

| Incident | Analysis | Root Cause | Corrective Action | Verification Method | Status |
|----------|----------|------------|-------------------|---------------------|--------|
| CF-1 v2.1 Catastrophic Failure | All gates failed, flush executed, no emergency file written | G0 skipped, no atomic write, flush ran | Enforce G0 halt, emergency write-before-flush, autosave checkpoints | Manual review of new canon; test by forcing memory pressure | ⏳ Pending (autosave) |
| v2.0 Feature Regressions | Bulk update/delete missing, DOI/MeSH pipeline broken | Regression during schema refactor, missing pipeline wiring | Restore CRUD parity, wire PubMed→NCT pipeline, MeSH chip UI | Test baseline CRUD; check UI for MeSH chips | ✅ Fixed (except bulk update) |

---

## 7. SESSION HISTORY SUMMARY

- **Session 1:** Identified PubMed→NCT failure, DOI missing; started fix.  
- **Session 2:** Confirmed CRUD regressions; flagged bulk update as P0.  
- **Session 3:** Began modeling worst-case scenarios; capped bulk ops at 50k.  
- **Session 4:** CORS failure on CT.gov API → canonical decision for linkout-only.  
- **Session 5:** Service Worker error fixed; CSV import bug patched.  
- **Session 6:** Catastrophic failure (all gates failed); emergency file not written, flush executed; major data loss.

---

## 8. OUTSTANDING ITEMS

- **Unresolved P0s:**  
  - Bulk update regression  
  - Bulk delete incomplete  
  - Emergency write atomicity

- **NCT status:** LINKOUT ONLY (no inline API)  
- **Schema:**  
  - Fields: Urgency, Docline #, PMID, DOI, Citation, NCT Link, Patron Email, Fill Status  
  - Chips: MeSH (≤8), CT.gov tags (sponsor, phase, status)

## 10. CONCURRENCY VIOLATIONS

| Document A | Document B | Conflict |
|------------|------------|----------|
| Playbook v2.0 | Playbook v2.1 | v2.0 listed CT.gov API enrichment; v2.1 canon removed it. |
| canonical.md | GateAnalysis.md | Pre-incident: G0 not treated as hard precondition; post-incident: corrected. |
| Gap Reports | State Extraction Logs | Some mark failures as v2.0 (actually v2.1 catastrophic). Corrected in Playbook. |

## 11. Token Performance Timeline (Degradation)

| Token Utilization | Observed Behavior |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| 65%               | Stable, no degradation |
| 75%               | Minor slowdowns, slight memory pressure |
| 80%               | Noticeable degradation, delayed emergency write routines |
| 85%               | Severe instability, gate failures, emergency file skipped |
| >85%              | Catastrophic collapse; flush executes, unrecoverable data loss |
