## 2. ALL CATASTROPHIC FAILURES (CF-1 through CF-2)

### CF-1 — 2025-08-12 Catastrophic v2.0 Failure
- **Timeline:** Attempted CT.gov enrichment → CORS crash → v2.0 initialization blocked → unrecoverable state.
- **Gate Status Matrix:**
  | Gate | Status |
  |------|--------|
  | G0 | ❌ Not defined |
  | G1 | ❌ Failed |
  | G2 | ❌ Failed |
  | G3 | ⏹ Not executed |
  | G4 | ⏹ Not reached |
- **Package Hashes:** NONE (no ZIP produced)
- **Corrective Actions:** Remove CT.gov enrichment, enforce linkout-only.
- **Classification:** Catastrophic startup failure.
- **Impact:** v2.0 DEPRECATED permanently.
- **Recovery:** Pivot to v2.1.
- **Prevention:** Canon prohibits enrichment.

### CF-2 — 2025-08-21 Gate Cascade Collapse
- **Timeline:** Required file not written → Flush executed → Gates bypassed → irrecoverable loss.
- **Gate Status Matrix:**
  | Gate | Status |
  |------|--------|
  | G0 | ❌ Failed |
  | G1 | ❌ Bypassed |
  | G2 | ❌ Bypassed |
  | G3 | ⏹ Not executed |
  | G4 | ⏹ Not reached |
- **Package Hashes:** NONE
- **Corrective Actions:** Add Gate 0, implement emergency IndexedDB snapshot.
- **Classification:** Catastrophic flush event.
- **Impact:** Total file loss.
- **Recovery:** Emergency snapshot now present.
- **Prevention:** Flush forbidden until ZIP packaged.
