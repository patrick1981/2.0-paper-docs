### 2. ALL CATASTROPHIC FAILURES

#### CF-1: v2.0 Startup Collapse
- **Timeline:**  
  - 2025-08-12 09:00 UTC — Attempt to initialize v2.0.  
  - 09:02 UTC — CT.gov enrichment blocked by CORS preflight.  
  - 09:03 UTC — Service Worker enters unstable state.  
  - 09:05 UTC — System crash; modules failed to load (0/13).  
  - 09:10 UTC — Declared catastrophic failure; v2.0 deprecated.

- **Gate Status Matrix:**  
  | Gate | Status | Notes |
  |------|--------|-------|
  | Gate 0 | N/A (not implemented yet) | — |
  | Gate 1 | Fail | Canonical baseline violated (CT.gov enrichment) |
  | Gate 2 | Fail | Required docs incomplete |
  | Gate 3 | Fail | Regression failed |
  | Gate 4 | Fail | Packaging impossible |

- **Package Hashes:** DOES NOT EXIST – NEEDED (no artifacts built).

- **Corrective Actions:**  
  - Pivot to v2.1.  
  - Strip CT.gov enrichment.  
  - Adopt NCT link-out-only.  
  - Harden SW scope.

- **Classification/Impact/Recovery/Prevention:**  
  - **Classification:** Catastrophic production failure.  
  - **Impact:** SilentStacks unusable; blocked demo.  
  - **Recovery:** Pivot to v2.1.  
  - **Prevention:** Canon rule: CT.gov enrichment prohibited.

#### CF-2: Packaging Audit Gaps
- **Timeline:**  
  - 2025-08-21 — Packaging audit run.  
  - Audit detected missing monolith HTML, SW, PDFs.  
  - Packaging blocked.  
  - Gate 0 created to enforce audits.

- **Gate Status Matrix:**  
  | Gate | Status | Notes |
  |------|--------|-------|
  | Gate 0 | Fail | No baseline rehydration |
  | Gate 1 | Pass | Canon flags intact |
  | Gate 2 | Fail | Missing required artifacts |
  | Gate 3 | Fail | Audit flagged broken links |
  | Gate 4 | Fail | Packaging blocked |

- **Package Hashes:**  
  - Manifest: DOES NOT EXIST – NEEDED.  
  - Audit: Missing.

- **Corrective Actions:** Gate 0 Operational Stability Safety introduced.

- **Classification/Impact/Recovery/Prevention:**  
  - **Classification:** Systemic packaging failure.  
  - **Impact:** Release blocked.  
  - **Recovery:** Add Gate 0.  
  - **Prevention:** Require Gate 0–3 pass, no stubs/placeholders.

  - Monolith HTML, Service Worker, PDF docs, MANIFEST.json.  

- **Broken Gates:**  
  - Gate 0, 2, 3, 4 currently failing.

### 10. CONCURRENCY VIOLATIONS

- **Docs vs Audit:** playbook.md claims complete canon, but packaging audit shows placeholders and stubs.  
- **Playbook vs Rules Charter:** Playbook references CT.gov linkouts; Rules Charter prohibits CT.gov entirely.  
- **Versioning:** Some chats reference v2.0 docs; current canon is v2.1 only.  
- **Packaging:** Audit logs show missing monolith and PDFs, but changelog.md marks packaging as complete.

### 11. Token Performance Timeline (Degradation)

| Token Usage % | Observed Behavior                         |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 65%           | Stable, full compliance with canon        |
| 75%           | Minor slowdowns; still stable             |
| 80%           | Degradation begins (slower audits)        |
| 85%           | Known collapse threshold; systemic drift  |
| 90%           | Severe degradation, high error likelihood |
| 95%           | Critical failure imminent                 |
