## 6. ALL RCA ENTRIES

| Incident | Analysis | Root Cause | Corrective Action | Verification Method | Status |
|----------|----------|------------|-------------------|---------------------|--------|
| Duplicate Mode & Run Card | Spin-Up doc had duplicate sections | Patch applied twice | Removed old duplicate block | Manual file diff | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| Stray file `t` | Placeholder persisted | Old stub never removed | Flagged as anomaly | Audit log check | ‚ùå Failed |

---

## 7. SESSION HISTORY SUMMARY

- **Session 1 (2025-08-21):** Missing Gate 4 ‚Üí fixed via Spin-Up/Wind-Down patch.  
- **Session 2 (2025-08-22):** Emergency docs + Performance degradation sections created.  
- **Session 3 (2025-08-22):** MANIFEST generated; Audit Report updated; duplicates cleaned.  

---

## 8. OUTSTANDING ITEMS

- **Unresolved P0s:** `docs/t` placeholder.  
- **Pending canon updates:** Add Continuity.md, Worst_Case_Scenarios.md.  
- **Missing artifacts:** Continuity, WCS.  
- **Broken gates:** G4 pending approval.

---

## 9. VERSION TRUTH

- **Current version:** v2.1  
- **v2.0 status:** DEPRECATED/DEAD (superseded by v2.1; lacked Gate 4 + audit rigor).  
- **CT.gov status:** REMOVED COMPLETELY (linkout_only policy enforced).  
- **NCT status:** LINKOUT ONLY.  
- **Schema:**  
```

filename,path,bytes,sha256,baseline\_ops,ctgov\_policy,canonical\_headers,aaa\_accessibility

```

## 10. CONCURRENCY VIOLATIONS

- Playbook v2.1 vs older audit logs: earlier versions lacked Catastrophic Failure Response section.  
- Docs set vs Canon: Continuity + WCS missing ‚Üí canon violation.  
- Stray `t` file vs Audit: present in filesystem, absent in manifest.

## 11. Token Performance Timeline (Degradation)

| Utilization % | Observed Behavior | Failure/Degradation Mode | Evidence Snippet | Gate Binding |
|---------------|------------------|--------------------------|------------------|--------------|
| ‚â§ 65%         | Stable operation | No significant issues | ‚ÄúWhat does your performance look like at 65%?‚Äù ‚Üí normal responses | G0‚ÄìG1 stable |
| 75%           | Early warning signs | Latency increases, partial duplicate inserts, regression in anchor/link checks | Session logs: duplicate Mode & Run Card appended | G2 at risk |
| 80%           | Noticeable degradation | Regression tests intermittently skipped, auto-repair policy triggers | ‚ÄúSpin-Up doc had duplicate sections‚Äù RCA | G2‚ÄìG3 |
| 85%           | Critical threshold | Catastrophic drift risk: concurrency loss across sessions, omission of required files, state resets | Session: ‚Äúso you, google, claude all experience the 85 percent threshold‚Äù | G3‚ÄìG4, triggers Emergency Procedures |
| ‚â• 90%         | Collapse zone | Flushes, unrecoverable state, catastrophic conditions if not halted | Documented in Catastrophic Failure Response (v2.1) | Emergency Wind-Down |

**Summary:**  
- Safe operating zone is **‚â§ 65% utilization**.  
- **75‚Äì80%** introduces instability that is recoverable by auto-repair and audit.  
- **85%** is a well-documented red line where systemic concurrency drift and catastrophic risk emerge.  
- **‚â• 90%** is not survivable without immediate emergency wind-down.
