## 2. ALL CATASTROPHIC FAILURES (CF-1 through CF-X)

### CF-1: CT.gov Collapse Timeline Gap
- **Timeline:** 2025-08-18, collapse of CT.gov enrichment pipeline.
- **Gate Status Matrix:**  
  - Gate 0 (Baseline Ops): ❌ Failed (timeline lost)  
  - Gate 1 (Baseline Canon Check): ✅ Passed  
  - Gate 2 (Artifact Completeness): ❌ Failed  
  - Gate 3 (Regression Test Matrix): ❌ Failed  
  - Gate 4 (Concurrency Control): Not yet implemented
- **Package Hashes:** DOES NOT EXIST – NEEDED
- **Corrective Actions:** Canonical update enforcing **CT.gov linkout-only**; removal of enrichment logic.
- **Classification:** Catastrophic data drift.  
- **Impact:** Broke trust in metadata enrichment pipeline.  
- **Recovery:** Pivot to linkout-only.  
- **Prevention:** Canonical rules + Gate 4 concurrency enforcement.

### CF-2: Stub Packaging Collapse
- **Timeline:** 2025-08-23, docs packaged as stubs.  
- **Gate Status Matrix:**  
  - Gate 0: ❌ Failed  
  - Gate 1: ❌ Failed  
  - Gate 2: ❌ Failed  
  - Gate 3: ❌ Failed  
  - Gate 4: ✅ Passed (detected concurrency drift)  
- **Package Hashes:** DOES NOT EXIST – NEEDED  
- **Corrective Actions:** Stub Detector rule; packaging fails if <10 lines.  
- **Classification:** Systemic packaging failure.  
- **Impact:** All distributed docs useless.  
- **Recovery:** Repackaged with checksums.  
- **Prevention:** Canonical File Check + Stub Detector.
