**Gate Matrix**

| Gate | Initial | Recovery | Restored | Current |
|------|---------|----------|----------|---------|

**Package Hashes**
- Pre-meltdown: Missing (manifest incomplete).  
- Post-meltdown: Regenerated with Gate 2 enforced.

**Corrective Actions**
- CSV-only (XLSX prohibited).  
- Gate 4 print/approve required.  
- CT.gov linkout-only.  
- Holding pattern enforced for all open P0s.  

**Classification/Impact/Recovery/Prevention**
- Classification: CF-1 Catastrophic Meltdown.  
- Impact: Canon drift, packaging collapse, concurrency failure.  
- Recovery: Operator flush + canon corrections.  
- Prevention: Stronger Gate enforcement + CSV-only.

**Package Hashes**
- Not generated — context loss.

**Corrective Actions**
- Marked as CF-2.  
- Requires full state reload by operator.  

**Classification/Impact/Recovery/Prevention**
- Classification: CF-2 Data Loss Event.  
- Impact: Lost context + continuity.  
- Recovery: Awaiting user re-upload.  
- Prevention: Canon update — context reset = automatic P0.
