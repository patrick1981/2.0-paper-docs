### 6. ALL RCA ENTRIES

| Incident | Analysis | Root Cause | Corrective Action | Verification Method | Status |
|----------|----------|------------|-------------------|---------------------|--------|
| CF-1 Catastrophic Meltdown | Skeleton docs, gate collapse | Gate enforcement absent | CSV-only, Gate 4 print/approve, linkout-only | Manifest audits, session logs | ✅ Verified |
| CF-2 Context Loss | State extractor failed | Interpreter reset/context overrun | Logged CF-2, requires reload | User must re-upload full canon | ❌ Open |
