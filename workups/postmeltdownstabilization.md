| 2025-08-22 | Residual NCT traces | NCT still in UI/JS after initial removal | Incomplete cleanup | Deep removal in HTML/JS/SW → `index_nctless.html`, `app_nctless.min.js`, `service-worker_clean.js` | *“oi. you were supposed to remove CT.gov data in these files. I still see it”* | ✅ Fixed |
| 2025-08-23 | Syntax break in JS | “bad class member definition” error | Over-aggressive regex editing corrupted minified JS | Rebuilt from clean bundle; reapplied targeted edits | *“Uncaught SyntaxError: bad class member definition app.min.js:35:4096”* | ✅ Fixed |

| 2025-08-23 | Schema drift | CSV/table still expected NCT | Old schema persisted in code | Locked canonical schema to 10 fields | *“CSV export matches 10 headers only”* | ✅ Fixed |
| 2025-08-23 | Dirty bulk input | “Dumpster-fire” data polluted records | No parser canon; free-text unvalidated | Canonized Bulk Parser (normalize, validate, dedupe, quarantine) | *“Worst case scenario for data parsing. Mixed dirty data…”* | ✅ Fixed |

### 2. ALL CATASTROPHIC FAILURES (CF-1 through CF-X)

| CF ID | Timeline | Gate Status Matrix | Package Hashes | Corrective Actions | Classification / Impact / Recovery / Prevention |
|-------|----------|--------------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| CF-1 | **Earlier v2.0 session (pre-Aug 20)** — catastrophic meltdown when CT.gov watchdog failed, memory ballooned ~850 MB, Step G loops triggered. | Gate 0 failed (Operational Stability breach); Gate 1–3 skipped; Gate 4 attempted with broken state. | SHA checksums invalid (file audit failed). | Emergency wind-down; operator flush; canon later updated (CT.gov linkout-only → removal). | **Classification:** Systemic meltdown. **Impact:** Full enrichment collapse, browser instability. **Recovery:** Manual flush, Playbook canon updates. **Prevention:** CT.gov removed; watchdog canon enforced. |

- **CT.gov status:** Removed completely  
- **NCT status:** Removed completely (not even linkout)  
- **Schema:**

### 10. CONCURRENCY VIOLATIONS

| Document A | Document B | Conflict |
|------------|------------|----------|
| Old Playbook (pre-Aug 20) | Current Playbook | Old allowed `.xlsx`; current canon is CSV-only |
| Gate 4 workflow doc (pre-fix) | Current Playbook | Old placed Playbook print in Gate 3; now fixed at Gate 4 |
| v1.2 schema docs | v2.0/2.1 schema docs | v1.2 included NCT; current canon is 10 fields w/out NCT |

# Token Performance Timeline (Degradation)

| Token Usage % | Observed Behavior |
|---------------|------------------|
| ~65% | System stable; normal latency. |
| ~75% | Early signs of slower parsing and delayed gate checks. |
| ~80% | Noticeable response degradation; minor syntax errors creeping into outputs. |
| ~85% | Threshold point — high risk of catastrophic meltdown (seen in earlier v2.0 session). Watchdog failed, memory ballooned, Step G loops triggered, operator forced emergency flush. |

**Conclusion:** SilentStacks sessions degrade predictably with token utilization. At ~85% usage, reliability collapses, leading to systemic failure unless Gate 0/Flush engages. Canon now codifies watchdog + removal of CT.gov to prevent recurrence.
