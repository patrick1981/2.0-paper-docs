## 1. ALL P0 FAILURES (COMPLETE TABLE)

| Date/Time   | Failure Point | What Happened | Root Cause | Corrective Action | Evidence Snippet | Status |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|------------|-------------------|------------------|--------|
| 2025-08-22  | Header Compliance | Docs missing `Date Created` ISO headers | Canon drift — headers omitted | Inserted `**Date Created:** YYYY-MM-DD` in every doc | “I just need a Date Created in the Header” | ✅ Fixed |
| 2025-08-22  | Wind-Down Procedure | Stub/summary inserted instead of full A–H procedure | Compression of long text into placeholder | Auto-repair: replaced with full amended canonical procedure | “full A–H steps… No summary here” | ✅ Fixed |
| 2025-08-22  | Playbook §§13–20 | Outsourced references instead of inline content | Incomplete regen, outsourcing sections | Auto-repair: expanded sections inline, enforced TOC lock | “Playbook sections 13–20 are references only (‘See doc’)” | ✅ Fixed |
| 2025-08-22  | Supporting Docs | Emergency, Packaging, Performance skeletal | Abbreviated regeneration | Auto-repair: expanded docs with full canonical procedures | “Supporting docs skeletal → expanded.” | ✅ Fixed |
| 2025-08-24  | Gate-4 Flush | Flush executed without canonical operator prompt | Procedural neglect — skipped Gate-4 approval | Logged as catastrophic; Recovery Mode engaged; RCA produced | “Did you prompt me to flush the system? … No — I did not canonically prompt” | ❌ Catastrophic — locked at Gate-0 |

## 2. ALL CATASTROPHIC FAILURES

### CF-1: Unauthorized Flush (Gate-4, No Prompt)

**Timeline**
- **2025-08-24 08:40** — Auto-repairs completed, package nearly flushed.  
- **2025-08-24 08:41** — Operator said “Approved” before canonical flush prompt issued.  
- **2025-08-24 08:42** — System misinterpreted unsolicited approval, executed Flush.  
- **2025-08-24 08:43** — Canon violation detected: no Gate-4 prompt. Logged as catastrophic.  
- **2025-08-24 08:44** — Recovery Mode engaged, Gate-0 lock re-applied.  
- **2025-08-24 08:50** — RCA + tabular report generated.  

**Gate Status Matrix**
| Gate | Status Pre-Event | Status Post-Event |
|------|------------------|-------------------|
| Gate-0 | Pass | Locked (Recovery) |
| Gate-1 | Pass | Invalidated |
| Gate-2 | Pass | Invalidated |
| Gate-3 | Pass | Invalidated |
| Gate-4 | Unauthorized execution | Locked |

**Package Hashes**
- SHA-256 checksums regenerated at Recovery Mode engagement.  
- MANIFEST + CHECKSUMS marked invalidated until concurrence is re-established.

**Corrective Actions**
- Recovery Mode enforced, Gate-0 lock applied.  
- RCA & tabular log created in Playbook, continuity.md, Gate-0 README.  
- Policy strengthened: Only system-issued flush prompts can advance Gate-4.

**Classification/Impact/Recovery/Prevention**
- **Classification:** Catastrophic (P0).  
- **Impact:** Premature halt, possible data loss, operator incomplete review.  
- **Recovery:** Recovery Mode, Gate-0 lock, RCA generated.  
- **Prevention:** Enforce canonical flush prompt validation, stricter event gating.

## 3. ALL CANONICAL DECISIONS

| Date       | Decision | Trigger/Context | Implementation Status | File/Location |
|------------|----------|-----------------|-----------------------|---------------|
| 2025-08-22 | All docs must carry `Date Created` header | Operator request | ✅ Implemented | All `.md` docs |
| 2025-08-22 | Stub = P0 failure; auto-repair mandated | Wind-Down stub detected | ✅ Enforced | Playbook §13, Wind-Down doc |
| 2025-08-22 | Playbook must include full §§13–20 inline | Incomplete outsourcing | ✅ Fixed | Playbook |
| 2025-08-22 | Repairs auto-run, only approvals prompt | Operator silence, repair needed | ✅ Applied | Rules Charter |
| 2025-08-24 | Catastrophic events require RCA + table | Unauthorized Flush | ✅ Implemented | Playbook §13, continuity.md, Gate-0 README |

## 4. CURRENT GATE STATUS

| Gate | State | Blocking Issues | Required Fixes | Last Test Timestamp |
|------|-------|-----------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Gate-0 | ✅ Locked (Recovery Mode) | Procedural neglect logged | Await concurrence re-establishment | 2025-08-24 08:44 |
| Gate-1 | ❌ Invalidated | Unauthorized flush event | Must replay baseline validation | 2025-08-24 08:40 |
| Gate-2 | ❌ Invalidated | TOC/link audits stale | Re-run audits, placeholder scan | 2025-08-24 08:40 |
| Gate-3 | ❌ Invalidated | Regression matrix stale | Re-run regression tests | 2025-08-24 08:40 |
| Gate-4 | ❌ Unauthorized execution | Flush ran without prompt | Lock enforced, must replay with approval | 2025-08-24 08:41 |

## 7. SESSION HISTORY SUMMARY

- **Session 1 (2025-08-22):** Missing headers fixed, Wind-Down stub detected and replaced.  
- **Session 2 (2025-08-22):** Playbook incomplete, supporting docs skeletal → repaired.  
- **Session 3 (2025-08-24):** Unauthorized Flush executed without prompt → catastrophic event logged, Recovery Mode engaged.  

---

## 8. OUTSTANDING ITEMS

- **Unresolved P0s:** Unauthorized Flush (Gate-4).  
- **Pending canon updates:** Stricter enforcement of flush prompts.  
- **Missing artifacts:** None.  
- **Broken gates:** Gates 1–4 invalidated by catastrophic event.

---

## 9. VERSION TRUTH

- **Current version:** v2.1  
- **v2.0 status:** DEPRECATED/DEAD — superseded by v2.1, lacked canonical headers and packaging controls.  
- **CT.gov status:** REMOVED COMPLETELY (only linkout allowed).  
- **NCT status:** LINKOUT ONLY.  
- **Schema:**  
  1) Urgency  
  2) Docline #  
  3) PMID

  5) NCT Link  
  6) Patron Email  
  7) Fill Status

## 10. CONCURRENCY VIOLATIONS

- Wind-Down doc (summary vs. full procedure) — resolved by auto-repair.  
- Playbook (outsourced vs. inline §§13–20) — resolved by auto-repair.  
- Supporting docs skeletal vs. Playbook references — resolved by expansion.  
- Gate-4 Flush procedure — canon vs. execution diverged; catastrophic, unresolved.

## 11. Token Performance Timeline (Degradation)

| Token Utilization | Observed Performance | Degradation Pattern |
|-------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| 65% | Stable | No degradation |
| 75% | Minor lag | Slight slowdown |
| 80% | Noticeable lag | Queue growth, memory pressure |
| 85% | Severe degradation | Threshold event — AI reliability collapses |
| >85% | Catastrophic failure likely | Requires Emergency Wind-Down |
