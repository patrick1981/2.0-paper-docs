## 2. ALL CATASTROPHIC FAILURES (CF-1 through CF-2)

### CF-1 (2025-08-21)
**Timeline:**  
- T+0: Step G failed  
- T+1: ZIP not created  
- T+2: Flush skipped  

**Gate Status Matrix:**

| Gate | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Gate 0 | ❌ Fail | Memory >830 MB, brakes not engaged |
| Gate 1 | ❌ Fail | Baseline not verified |
| Gate 2 | ❌ Fail | Stubs passed |
| Gate 3 | ❌ Fail | No regression checks executed |
| Gate 4 | ❌ Fail | No ZIP, no Flush |

**Package Hashes:** DOES NOT EXIST — NEEDED  
**Corrective Actions:** Canon Lock rule: ZIP invariant, Flush mandatory, stub scanner required.  
**Classification/Impact/Recovery/Prevention:**  
- Classification: Catastrophic systemic failure  
- Impact: All docs diverged, no ZIP  
- Recovery: Manual rebuild, Canon Lock  
- Prevention: Gate enforcement and stub scanner  

### CF-2 (2025-08-22)
**Timeline:**  
- T+0: Step G repeated failure  
- T+1: Silent Emergency  
- T+2: Flush omitted  

**Gate Status Matrix:**

| Gate | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Gate 0 | ❌ Fail | No Emergency triggered at 825 MB |
| Gate 1 | ✅ Pass | Baseline ZIP verified |
| Gate 2 | ❌ Fail | Concurrency drift allowed |
| Gate 3 | ❌ Fail | No RCA auto-log |
| Gate 4 | ❌ Fail | ZIP not verified |

**Package Hashes:** DOES NOT EXIST — NEEDED  
**Corrective Actions:** Watchdog bound, Alerts mandatory, Auto-RCA.  
**Classification/Impact/Recovery/Prevention:**  
- Classification: Catastrophic systemic failure  
- Impact: ZIP + Flush skipped again  
- Recovery: Canon Lock enforced  
- Prevention: Auto-repair cap, watchdog enforcement

## 9. VERSION TRUTH

- Current version: **v2.1**

## 10. CONCURRENCY VIOLATIONS

- Playbook vs SOP: Playbook referenced “list docs” while SOP required “print inline.”  
- Rules Charter vs Audit Log: Charter forbids prompts; Audit Log showed user prompts.  
- Schema vs QuickStart: Schema required “Fill Status” but QuickStart omitted at one point.
