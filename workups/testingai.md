## 6. ALL RCA ENTRIES

| Incident | Analysis | Root Cause | Corrective Action | Verification Method | Status |
|----------|----------|------------|------------------|---------------------|--------|
| Gate 0 intake miss | Package advanced without intake audit | Operator skipped Gate 0 | Enforced Gate 0 audit | Upload audit log | ✅ Fixed |
| Manifest drift | Drift in checksums post-seal | Manifest frozen pre-seal | Auto-rebuild inside ZIP | G2 re-validation | ✅ Fixed |
| G3 doc failures | H1/v2.1 missing, Run Card incomplete | Documentation inconsistent | Auto-repair docs | G3 validation PASS | ✅ Fixed |
| Resume ambiguity | Wrong file printed for resume | Canon unclear | Clarified canon (Resume_Points.md only) | Resume points print check | ✅ Fixed |
| Modeling misplacement | Modeling docs in `/docs` | Structure not enforced | Moved to `docs/modeling`, fixed links | File tree check | ✅ Fixed |
| Catastrophic continuity breach | Baseline not validated at intake | Gate 0 miss | Catastrophic recovery loop | Gate cycle full PASS | ✅ Fixed |
| Missing origin timestamps | No session origin recorded | Interpreter resets, logs incomplete | Logged as “Unknown; data loss” | Canonical Behavior Display | ❌ Failed |

---

## 7. SESSION HISTORY SUMMARY

- **Session 1**: Uploaded ZIP, skipped Gate 0 audit → P0 failure.  
- **Session 2**: Wind-down run; manifest drift caused G2 fail. Fixed via auto-repair.  
- **Session 3**: G3 fails (titles, v2.1 mentions, Run Card incomplete). Fixed.  
- **Session 4**: Resume points clarified; canon updated.  
- **Session 5**: Modeling docs misplacement fixed.  
- **Session 6**: Catastrophic failure flagged; Gate 0 audit retroactively run. Full recovery cycle executed.  
- **Session 7**: Sealed RECOVERED_FINAL package with PASS.  

---

## 8. OUTSTANDING ITEMS

- **Unresolved P0s:** Missing origin timestamps (data loss).  
- **Pending canon updates:** Enforce persistent session origin logging across resets.  
- **Missing artifacts:** None.  
- **Broken gates:** None (current PASS).  

---

## 9. VERSION TRUTH

- **Current version:** v2.1  
- **v2.0 status:** DEPRECATED — lacked canonical headers, bulk caps, linkout-only policy.  
- **CT.gov status:** REMOVED COMPLETELY (no enrichment).  
- **NCT status:** LINKOUT ONLY.  
- **Schema:**  
  1. Urgency  
  2. Docline #  
  3. PMID  
  4. Citation  
  5. NCT Link  
  6. Patron E-mail  
  7. Fill Status  

---

## 10. CONCURRENCY VIOLATIONS

- Playbook vs Resume_Points.md: Playbook originally suggested “deployment-ready”; Resume_Points corrected to **“modeled, not deployed.”**  
- Multiple sealed versions labeled FINAL_SEALED2, SEALEAD3, RECOVERED_FINAL without consistent temporal anchors.  
- Origin timestamps missing → Canon tables vs actual package logs diverged.
