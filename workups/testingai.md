## 2. ALL CATASTROPHIC FAILURES (CF-1 through CF-X)

### CF-1 — Gate 0 Auto-Engage Failure

- **Timeline**
  - 2025-08-24T19:15:16Z: Uploaded package bypassed Gate 0 (auto-engage did not trigger).
  - 2025-08-24T19:20:00Z: User flagged catastrophic failure.
  - 2025-08-24T19:30:00Z: Manual Catastrophic Recovery loop engaged → Gate 0 brake applied, audit executed.
  - 2025-08-24T19:40:00Z: G2 drift + G3 gaps detected.
  - 2025-08-24T20:00:00Z: Auto-repair cycle completed, resealed package.
  - 2025-08-24T20:30:00Z: All gates PASS on recovered artifact.

- **Gate Status Matrix**
  | Phase | G0 | G1 | G2 | G3 |
  |-------|----|----|----|----|
  | Intake (expected auto-engage) | ❌ FAIL | N/A | N/A | N/A |
  | Recovery step 1 | ✅ PASS | ✅ PASS | ❌ FAIL | ❌ FAIL |
  | Recovery step 2 | ✅ PASS | ✅ PASS | ✅ PASS | ✅ PASS |

- **Package Hashes**
  - Original uploaded: drifted manifest (invalid).
  - Recovered sealed: SHA256 validated PASS.

- **Corrective Actions**
  - Manual Catastrophic Recovery loop initiated.
  - Gate 0 brake engaged manually.
  - Manifest rebuilt.
  - G3 doc fixes applied.
  - Resealed + validated package.

- **Classification**: P0 Catastrophic Failure  
- **Impact**: Continuity breach; baseline safety not applied at intake.  
- **Recovery**: Manual Catastrophic Recovery loop completed.  
- **Prevention**: Enforce Gate 0 auto-engage on all future uploads.

## 6. ALL RCA ENTRIES

| Incident | Analysis | Root Cause | Corrective Action | Verification Method | Status |
|----------|----------|------------|------------------|---------------------|--------|
| Gate 0 intake miss | Intake audit skipped | Auto-engage not firing | Manual Catastrophic Recovery loop | Gate 0 audit rerun | ✅ Fixed |
| Manifest drift | Drifted checksums post-seal | Manifest frozen pre-seal | Auto-rebuild inside ZIP | G2 validation PASS | ✅ Fixed |
| G3 doc failures | H1/v2.1 missing, Run Card incomplete | Docs inconsistent | Auto-repair docs | G3 validation PASS | ✅ Fixed |
| Resume ambiguity | Wrong file printed | Canon unclear | Clarified canon (Resume_Points.md only) | Resume points check | ✅ Fixed |
| Modeling misplacement | Docs in `/docs` not `docs/modeling` | Layout not enforced | Relocated, fixed cross-links | File tree check | ✅ Fixed |
| Catastrophic continuity breach | Session advanced without baseline | Gate 0 miss | Catastrophic Recovery loop | Gate cycle full PASS | ✅ Fixed |
| Missing origin timestamps | Session origins not logged | Interpreter resets | Canon updated to log “Unknown; data loss” | Canonical Behavior Display | ❌ Failed |

## 7. SESSION HISTORY SUMMARY

- **Session 1**: Uploaded ZIP, Gate 0 skipped → P0 + CF-1 triggered.  
- **Session 2**: Manifest drift discovered, G2 auto-repair run.  
- **Session 3**: G3 fails (titles, v2.1 tags, Run Card incomplete) auto-repaired.  
- **Session 4**: Resume ambiguity clarified (Resume_Points.md only).  
- **Session 5**: Modeling docs relocated + links fixed.  
- **Session 6**: Catastrophic recovery loop run; resealed RECOVERED package.  
- **Session 7**: RECOVERED_FINAL package validated (G0–G3 PASS).  

---

## 8. OUTSTANDING ITEMS

- **Unresolved P0s:** Missing origin timestamps (logged as data loss).  
- **Pending canon updates:** Enforce persistent session origin logging across resets; Gate 0 auto-engage automation.  
- **Missing artifacts:** None.  
- **Broken gates:** None (current PASS).  

---

## 9. VERSION TRUTH

- **Current version:** v2.1  
- **v2.0 status:** DEPRECATED — lacked canonical headers, bulk caps, linkout-only policy.  
- **CT.gov status:** REMOVED COMPLETELY (no enrichment).  
- **NCT status:** LINKOUT ONLY.  
- **Schema:**  
  1. Urgency  
  2. Docline #  
  3. PMID  
  4. Citation  
  5. NCT Link  
  6. Patron E-mail  
  7. Fill Status  

---

## 10. CONCURRENCY VIOLATIONS

- Playbook vs Resume_Points.md: Playbook implied “deployment-ready”; Resume_Points.md corrected to “**modeled, not deployed**.”  
- Multiple sealed package labels (FINAL_SEALED2, FINAL_SEALED3, RECOVERED_FINAL) with inconsistent timestamp anchoring.  
- Missing origin timestamps caused divergence between Canon tables and package logs.

| 2025-08-24T19:15:16Z | Catastrophic Failure | ~85% | Continuity breach, Gate 0 skipped | Catastrophic CF-1 | Catastrophic |
| 2025-08-24T20:30:00Z | Recovery Cycle | ~70% | Post-repair stability | None | Stable |
